"""Every dialog footer routes through the one Enter-target helper.

Qt hands "default" to whichever autoDefault button was clicked last (issue #997), so a footer
that pins nothing repeats the last click on Enter. The static walk keeps a new dialog from
shipping without the helper; the behaviour itself is covered by the templates tests.
