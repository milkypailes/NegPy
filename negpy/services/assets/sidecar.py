    Both fallbacks are keyed by path, so they only apply where the hash *is* the identity
    of the file at that path. Three kinds of asset break that:

    - a **half-frame**, which shares its path with the other half; a path match would
      steal the sibling's edit.
    - a **composite** (HDR merge, stitch), whose path is its reference frame's. A path
      match hands the composite that frame's whole edit — its rotation, its film process
      — and `rehome_file_settings` then *moves* the row, so the source frame loses its
      own edit. That is how a merge of five slides opened rotated and in the wrong mode.
    - a **roll-forked edit**, which shares its path with the roll's shared edit. A path
      match would hand the fork the shared edit, and rehoming it would delete the shared
      row out from under every other roll still using it.

    A composite or a fork skips the sidecar too: the `.negpy` beside the source describes
    the shared frame, not a variant of it.
