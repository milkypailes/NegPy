"""Batch CLIP embedding generation for search by meaning: the same async/semaphore
shape as thumbnails.generate_batch_thumbnails, reusing get_thumbnail_worker's own
disk cache so indexing a session costs no second RAW decode -- a file whose thumbnail
was just generated is a cached JPEG read here, not a re-decode.

The controller only ever passes files with no cached vector for the active
MODEL_VERSION (a single bulk load_embeddings_for query, not a check per file here).
