"""Composite membership: which files a stitch or an HDR merge is built from.

A composite is a user decision, not a fact about the files: nothing in a part scan
says which other scans it was stitched to, and no measurement can recover the choice.
So the grouping is remembered here, keyed by the composite's primary path, and it
lives until the user dissolves the composite — not until the file list changes.

Edits are not stored here. They stay in the edits DB under the composite's own
content hash (``stitch_hash`` / ``hdr_hash``), which is derived from the parts, so
re-forming the same composite finds its edit again.
