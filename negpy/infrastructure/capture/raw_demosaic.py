"""Linear sensor-RGB demosaic for calibration metering.

Follows NegPy's canonical RAW decode (`ImageProcessor._decode_sensor_rgb`): sensor-native
`output_color=raw`, no white balance, linear gamma, 16-bit — so calibration meters the film base
the same way the RGB-Scan merge later reads the channels. rawpy is imported lazily so the module
stays import-safe.

It shares both scale-reference parameters with the canonical decode
(`image_processor.py:_decode_sensor_rgb`): `adjust_maximum_thr=0.0`, which disables LibRaw's
per-frame maximum substitution and scales each frame by a fixed reference instead of its own
brightest pixel — required for a meter comparing frames — and `user_sat=_user_sat(raw)` (see
`_user_sat`), which pins that reference to the camera's calibrated linearity limit rather than
LibRaw's generic ADC ceiling.
