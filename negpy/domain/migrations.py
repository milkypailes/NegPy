"""
Backward-compat migrations for persisted configs (edits.db rows, .negpy sidecars,
export presets). Every legacy key rename, value rewrite and retired-field drop
belongs here — add new ones to this module, not to ``from_flat_dict``.

Not here: coercions that must run on *every* construction rather than only on load
— ``ExposureConfig.__post_init__`` (legacy 0-5 paper grade → ISO R, cast_removal
bool → strength), ``ProcessConfig.__post_init__`` (pre-rename process-mode names,
which also arrive from sticky settings and asset dicts) and the tuple-rehydrating
``__post_init__``s. String literals only (no ``domain.models`` import — that module
imports this one).

Also not here: migrations that rewrite *rows* rather than a config payload, since those
need a repository and this module stays dependency-free. They live in
``services/assets/migrations/``, one module per migration. A one-time value rewrite
there needs a done flag rather than a per-load equality check, since a load can't tell
a legacy row from a value the user just saved.
