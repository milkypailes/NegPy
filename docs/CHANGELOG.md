# Change Log

## 0.63.0

- New: **Retouch Clone tool** — Alt-click sets a source, and painting copies it with an aligned offset; the heal tool stays fast as strokes add up. @PabloRuizCuevas
- New: **Darkroom contact sheet** — the roll printed as film strips 1:1 on Ilford paper, with rebate, edge print and an optional Straight Proof; replaces the pixel-grid templates. @s6stkurz
- New: **Merge to TIFF Negative** — a trichrome triplet or stitch becomes one 16-bit linear TIFF that keeps its edit. @kurtwindisch
- New: **Geometry tools** — Auto Skew squares the frame to its film edges, and the Tilt and Swing tool solves keystone from four marked edges. @jondestoppeleire @matthoosier
- New: **Canvas panning** — Space + left-drag pans, and drags auto-pan at the edge of a zoomed image. @matthoosier
- New: **Scan as Roll** — scans open as a Library roll and frames load as they land; Folder as Roll scans straight into a roll folder.
- New: **Interactive tour** — chaptered, with steps that wait for you to act and a demo negative.
- New: **Scanning additions** — live view focus meter and frame border @seanharding; Eject When Done, nkscan debug log and strip offset markers @thetalkingdrum.
- New: **Menu additions** — Close Roll in the Library and Film Strip menus, and frame resets in the canvas menu. @thetalkingdrum
- Change: **Optical Removal hair detection** — Hair Threshold is a separate slider from Spot Threshold and rises along tonal edges, so bright rims are no longer taken for hairs; Size goes down to 2 px.
- Change: **Update Thumbnails renders only stale frames**, with progress and time left. @thetalkingdrum
- Change: **Linear Output can apply lens correction.** @thetalkingdrum
- Change: **UI polish** — right-aligned slider labels, toggles in place of Export's checkboxes, the wheel never edits a box, and dialogs remember their size and position. @s6stkurz
- Change: **Trichrome Mode is remembered per roll.** @thetalkingdrum
- Change/Fix: **ISO-R Grade defaults to 115 R everywhere**, and Crosstalk Strength to 0. @kurtwindisch
- Fix: **Geometry** — Half Frame splits along the detected axis, Tilt and Swing follow a turn or flip, embedded lens correction fills the frame, and the crop view leaves out the border and keeps negative peek. @jondestoppeleire @thetalkingdrum @matthoosier
- Fix: **Responsiveness and display** — a click never waits behind a prefetch, one click closes a dropdown, the canvas overlay is color-managed on GPU, and X-Trans camera-WB previews decode at full size. @jondestoppeleire @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **Camera Scanning** — Live View keys work on macOS and in floating windows, and lossy raws are not read as clipped. @kurtwindisch @seanharding
- Fix: **Library and resets** — Roll Settings scopes and filters, crop defaults on a fresh frame, card resets that cleared the scanning setup, and settings lost on an empty Film Strip. @kurtwindisch

## 0.62.0

- Change: **UX pass**
  - **Find** — Ctrl+K or the Controls panel's title box reaches every slider, card and action by name or by a common synonym ("contrast" finds ISO-R Grade); a slider hit is a live control.
  - **Light Table** — Shift+G shows the roll as a grid across the whole window.
  - **Reference view** — Shift+R pins a frame beside the canvas to match the roll to it; Draw Region moves to Ctrl+R.
  - **Compact panels** — sliders are one row (label, track, value) with values always shown, and a slider's modifiers sit under it behind a rail; a row of either-or buttons becomes one dropdown, and small tools sit on the section headers. Cast Removal moves to the Roll tab's Calibration card, Protect Original Metadata to the Metadata tab, and Tone's auto helpers into one Auto menu; Sync Metadata to Batch, Filtration's Roll Lock and the Show slider values preference are retired.
  - **Labeled tabs** — tabs carry text labels, and the Color tab is now Look.
  - **More room for the canvas** — the logo header is gone (About and updates are in the ⋯ menu), and Shift+H hides both side panels.
  - **Edit Toolbar** can place the actions that were only in the ⋯ menu.
- New: **Preflash** — a uniform paper pre-exposure in the print curve that lifts highlights near the paper's threshold and leaves the rest; print only.
- New: **Single-edge crop handles** — drag one side of the crop at a time. @matthoosier
- New: **Plustek Multi-Pass scanning** — a Scan mode combo (Single-Pass, Multi-Pass, Adaptive Multi-Exposure, Adaptive Multi-Pass) with a Passes slider stacks repeated exposures for less noise; not with IR. @TobbyTravel
- New: **Hide the GPU memory warning** — a Preferences → Performance option; the warning no longer shows on CPU renders. @kurtwindisch
- Change: **Filed carrier rebate** — the rebate prints through the frame's curves and filtration, the edge is filed in straight strokes with nicks near the corners, the film sits off center in the aperture, and flare takes the paper's toe color.
- Change: **More Pakon and Noritsu scan sizes** — Pakon TLX dimensions are read from the file header; four more 5028-high Noritsu sizes are recognized. @thetalkingdrum
- Change: **Crash reports go to negpy.log** — `~/negpy_boot.log` is gone. @seanharding
- Fix: **Stitch cuts a seam through the overlap** — detail the alignment cannot match is no longer doubled. @kurtwindisch
- Fix: **Slide fixes** — a Flat export of a raw slide gets no second white balance, Zone placement is off on an as-captured slide, the Half Frame dialog shows a slide as a positive, and Before resets to the shipped defaults.
- Fix: **Dye Separation on saturated slide colors** — a clipped channel no longer speckles a blue sky. @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **Half Frame scans with a detected rebate** — Auto-detect All Splits no longer breaks thumbnails, export and the Half Frame dialog; affected scans are repaired. @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **Editing a Roll-tab card on an empty roll no longer crashes.** @kurtwindisch

## 0.61.0

- New: **Nested roll discovery** — Import Subfolders as Rolls finds roll folders at any depth and shows them in a tree under their parent folders; Refresh finds new folders and marks rolls whose folder is gone; Discovery Filters (default `export`) skip folders by name; a folder with no images of its own imports its subfolders.
- New: **Sort the Film Strip by scene** — each scene's frames form their own block on a band in the scene's color, and Show Scenes edges each frame in its scene color. @s6stkurz
- New: **Exposure lock for nkscan roll scanning** — Meter Frame… on the Scan panel fixes the exposure for every frame of a roll, so frames at the strip ends match the rest; needs nkscan 0.12, which also retries an incomplete frame pass.
- Fix: **HQ preview and export of a large slide match the preview** — the transfer curve is metered the same way in tiled renders. @thetalkingdrum

## 0.60.0

- New: **Rolls and the Roll tab** — the Library is a list of rolls: folder rolls, color-coded, and virtual rolls built from any frames. A photo in more than one roll can get its own edit per roll. The Roll tab holds roll-wide defaults for Film Mode, Frame Assembly (Trichrome, Half Frame with per-roll auto-detect), Calibration, Crop, Raw Decode, Optics, Roll Analysis, Metering and Metadata. Every card header has a Frame/Roll switch, and a frame you change is locked on that card until Apply pushes it back. Presets move to Favorites, and the export destination defaults to a subfolder of the roll. @PabloRuizCuevas
- New: **Scenes** — group frames of a roll into a scene with its own normalization baseline; Batch Analysis is now Roll Analysis. Baselines compare whole frames, and a frame far from the rest keeps its own bounds.
- New: **Roll-wide Cast Removal** — Roll and Scene Analysis also measure each frame's gray balance. With Use Average: Cast on, the frames of a roll or scene share its color curve, and each frame keeps its own midtone level. Color Negative only. Cast Removal defaults to 1.0 on Color Negative; existing edits keep their saved strength.
- New: **Roll Settings… and Search by meaning** — tag gear and capture metadata across a frame, a selection or a roll, with camera, film stock, ISO and date suggested from the folder name. Search is an opt-in CLIP search across a roll or the whole library. @PabloRuizCuevas
- New: **Embedded lens correction for Sony ARW and DNG** — separate Distortion and CA toggles from the file's own metadata. @hsnilsson
- New: **Exclude areas from Optical Removal** — right-drag paints a band the detector leaves alone. @s6stkurz
- New: **More controls on Slide** — highlight reconstruction (Off / Blend / Reconstruct), Dye Separation and Separation Damping without Normalize, and White/Black Point on the transfer path. @thetalkingdrum
- New: **Batch edits across the Film Strip** — rotate and flip turn every selected frame, Reset Roll to Defaults… undoes a setting pushed to the whole roll, and thumbnails of edited frames refresh in the background (plus a manual Update Thumbnails). @thetalkingdrum
- New: **Master switch for carrying settings to a new frame.** @PabloRuizCuevas
- New: **Tone Limit on Dodge & Burn masks** — a mask can act only on tones lighter or darker than a zone of the print, like a lith mask, so a sky burn stops at the skyline. Invert moves to a toggle on each mask row.
- Change: **Positive is a Slide-only setting** and applies to the whole roll; Auto Density and Auto Grade work on it. @PabloRuizCuevas
- Change: **Faster, lighter navigation** — Film Strip previews stream in the background with bounded memory, and neighbor prefetch works again on scan TIFFs and camera RAWs. @hsnilsson
- Change: **User Guide and Pipeline docs rewritten** — shorter and plainer, including the in-app ⓘ guides.
- Fix: **Correct defaults everywhere** — new files and resets use the calibrated grade, crosstalk and auto crop. On a slide, Cast Removal keeps the value you set, and reset and Before/After use the slide default of 0. @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **Slide Shadows/Highlights color balance works.** @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **RAW decode clips at the camera's calibrated white level.** @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **Shift/Ctrl-click multi-select in the Film Strip is reliable.** @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **Small UI fixes** — the Analysis Buffer overlay stays visible while its slider is held, and the spinner shows on a slow reload. @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **Hot Folder no longer offers a rejected duplicate again.** @PabloRuizCuevas

## 0.59.0

- New: **Per-frame registration in the Coolscan strip preview** — every frame tile gets its own offset slider on top of the roll-wide Offset and Drift, for a splice or a mis-fired advance; tiles gain a size slider, the detected boundary is outlined in the accent color, a measured strip finds its frames as the dialog opens, and a moved offset re-cuts the tile. Needs nkscan 0.11.0, which also fixes tile pitch and low-DPI scans on the LS-5000.
- New: **TIFF (mono) scan format** — one 16-bit gray plane for single-record film, a third the size; NegPy reads its own mono scans back.
- New: **Positive** — a Process toggle beside Normalize for a source that is already a finished positive: it decodes the file's own profile and skips the as-captured lift and highlight roll-off. @PabloRuizCuevas
- New: **Per-frame half-frame splits** — a scan can use its own detected gutter or a hand-set one, applied to the current, selected or all frames; heal strokes, spots, lines and masks re-anchor across a split or crop change. @PabloRuizCuevas
- New: **Peek Embedded Preview** — the camera's own JPEG of the capture, as an outside reference for the decode; every peek now badges the canvas, checks in the menu, and leaves with Esc. @seanharding
- New: **Per-mask enable/disable** — click a mask's shape icon in Dodge & Burn to suppress it without deleting it; the tint overlay and Printing Notes skip it. @thetalkingdrum
- Change: **DNG scan output retired** — scans write TIFF; reading LinearRaw DNGs is unchanged.
- Change: **UI consistency pass** — toasts colored by severity and a failed export no longer blanks the canvas, a GPU viewport that fails to start says so and falls back to CPU, dock layout and active tab survive a restart, one Enter target per dialog, one section factory with a ⓘ guide, every color and size from the theme, one spelling and casing scheme, and the keyboard docs and tutorial read the shortcut registry.
- Change: **Fast interactive geometry drags** — fine rotation, keystone and the crop tool no longer drop to the CPU engine or re-measure the frame per step. @PabloRuizCuevas
- Change: **Painted heal strokes bake incrementally** — a new stroke no longer re-runs every earlier one. @PabloRuizCuevas
- Change: **Lower memory for Linear DNG decoding and CPU export.** @hsnilsson
- Fix: **Optical Removal's Threshold reaches past 12σ** — the top of the slider now runs to 48σ, where a specular highlight or a rail edge sits, so those can be gated out; a setting at or below the default renders as before.
- Fix: **Stale Narrowband flag tinted a slide green** — the flag is now inert on a transparency everywhere. @seanharding
- Fix: **Peek Negative renders the way the negative looks** — as-shot multipliers fold in and the view gets a brightness level, so an orange mask reads as one. @seanharding
- Fix: **Linear Output records the demosaic algorithm it ran.** @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **Arrow keys step a slider by its declared step** — fractional sliders moved by 1/precision, so a Grade press moved 0.01 ISO-R. @PabloRuizCuevas
- Fix: **No traceback while dragging Border Width** — a retired texture could be drawn from between frames. @dtrtuser
- Fix: **Filename and contact-sheet path fields keep the cursor while typing.** @TobbyTravel
- Fix: **Scanlight v4b recognized** — the newer v4 PCB has white LEDs, so the W slider and the White Light preset work. @ianfyffe
- Fix: **JPEG exports with GPS or PrintImageMatching tags are readable** — high-numbered camera tags broke IFD0 order and the dates and coordinates after it. @jihorba
- Fix: **Exported files carry the source's filesystem dates** — mtime, and the creation date on macOS. @jihorba

## 0.58.0

- New: **Print tone grounded in the photofinishing literature** — the default print envelope, Auto Grade and Auto Density were retuned against published preferred-reproduction data; both meters now read textured parts of the frame only, so rebate, sky and flat walls no longer set grade or exposure. **Retune your Auto Grade and Auto Density targets** — existing frames on the automatic helpers will print differently.
- New: **Shadow Reach and Highlight Hold** — two Set Targets tunables that place the ends of the print automatically: the darkest textured tone is held to a minimum print density, and the brightest gets an automatic highlight burn so it keeps tone instead of going paper white. Either can be turned off with 0.
- New: **Low VRAM export tiling** — a Preferences option (Performance) that halves the tile size and drops readback pipelining for tiled exports, for integrated GPUs that ran out of shared memory mid-export. @TobbyTravel
- New: **Windows startup falls back to a writable data folder** — when the default data folder is blocked, a dialog offers Local AppData or lets you pick another folder; nothing is copied, the choice is remembered. @hsnilsson
- Change: **Optical Removal rebuilt** — the detector was measured against the IR channel and rewritten: a local-noise threshold instead of an absolute one, min-pooled detection at full detail, and seed-and-grow so a mark covers the whole speck and a hair joins into one piece. It now finds many times more of what IR sees; on strongly textured film some marks are given up to protect image detail.
- Change: **Sharpening rolls off in the deep shadows** — both sharpen methods reduce gain toward paper black, where grain is coarsest relative to detail.
- Change: **Faster startup, navigation and export** — the first render and window build are quicker, switching files no longer stalls the interface, and tiled export, 16-bit TIFF encoding and the IR/dust bakes are several times faster. An export after a full-resolution preview reuses that preview's detection and repair work.
- Change: **Brighter interface text** — every text color moved a step brighter, disabled text most of all, and the stylesheet now takes its colors from the theme instead of its own copies.
- Fix: **Printability read-out with a source-only input ICC** — narrowband scans with soft proof on lost the read-out and logged an error.
- Fix: **Toggle buttons no longer draw a focus outline.**
- Fix: **Two film or sensor profiles with similar names** — "Portra 400" and "Portra-400" resolved to the same file, so saving one destroyed the other. @MohammedAlkindi
- Fix: **Batch progress during Hot Folder** — a manual Add Files or Add Folder import ran with no progress dialog while the Hot Folder toggle was on. @MohammedAlkindi
- Fix: **GPS coordinates in exported metadata** — rounded seconds and minutes now carry into minutes and degrees. @MohammedAlkindi
- Fix: **File sizes pick the right unit** — a size just under a threshold showed as "1024.0 KB". @MohammedAlkindi
- Fix: **Startup no longer flashes small unparented windows** — toolbar, scan light and section-help widgets parent correctly before showing. @hsnilsson
- Fix: **Optional inter-exposure delay for trichrome capture** — some older USB/PTP cameras need a pause between red/green/blue captures; default stays zero. @matthoosier

## 0.57.0

- New: **Demosaic panel** — pick the CFA interpolation for preview and export separately, under Calibration; the list is built from what your libraw build supports and Auto keeps the previous behavior.
- New: **Soft Proof section on the Export tab** — printer and paper presets, rendering intent, black point compensation, simulate paper white and simulate ink black, a gamut warning, and the monitor profile; the proof profile follows the Export profile or can be set on its own, so you can proof a print while exporting a web JPEG.
- New: **Printability and Repair read-outs in Analysis** — the share of the frame the proof profile cannot print, and the share of the scan each repair route (IR, dust, painted) rewrote.
- New: **Cast Removal on transparencies** — the slider now works on slides, for faded E-6 originals with a shadow/highlight crossover; slides start at 0, negatives at 0.5.
- New: **Scanners reach their native per-axis resolution** — DPI values a device offers only on x are now usable, with y resampled up after the read; IR capture still refuses a DPI that needs resampling. @dtrtuser
- Change: **Lens distortion is a per-image control** — moved out of the flat-field profile into Alignment beside Tilt and Swing, so a rig with no profile can use it; finer 0.001 steps over ±0.10.
- Change: **UI consistency pass** — one font scale, readable hint text, one control family and one button width across the panels, radio buttons and a focus ring in dialogs, and one Enter target per dialog footer; Flat Field is rebuilt on the shared panel layout and the Calibration and Flat Field resets are connected.
- Fix: **Trichrome triplets assemble reliably** — frame agreement is scored in density rather than linear levels, so exposures several stops apart are no longer refused; a restored session groups the files it left loose, and a capture hands its own three exposures to discovery, so a frame with no detail in it still stacks. @seanharding
- Fix: **Plustek multi-exposure scan alignment** — pyOpticfilm updated to 1.3.3. @jboneng
- Fix: **Hot folder no longer re-imports open files on Windows** — paths were compared raw, so a different separator or letter case read as a new file. @MohammedAlkindi
- Fix: **`path:` search queries match on Windows** — backslashes were stripped as escapes before the matcher saw them, so a documented query returned nothing. @MohammedAlkindi

## 0.56.0

- New: **One Export profile control** — color spaces and imported ICC profiles in a single combo, so the ICC can no longer silently override a live-looking color-space choice; Import ICC copies a profile into `~/NegPy/icc` with no restart, Same as Source names the space it resolves to, and Soft Proof with its warning moves beside the profile it describes.
- New: **TIFF, PNG and JPEG export options** — Bit Depth (8/16, for TIFF, PNG and JXL), TIFF Compression (Uncompressed/LZW/ZIP), PNG Compression (0-9) and JPEG Progressive; JPEG optimize is always on. RGB PNG now exports 16-bit by default.
- Change: **Plustek backend updated to pyOpticfilm 1.3.** @jboneng
- Fix: **Flatbed scanners switch to their transparency source before scanning** — a flatbed+TPU device ran every film scan in reflective mode with the lamp off, and probed its geometry against the flatbed area, so crops and requested DPI landed wrong. @dtrtuser
- Fix: **Slide with an Input ICC no longer corrects primaries twice** — an active Input ICC replaces the raw's embedded camera matrix instead of stacking on it, matching negatives and narrowband. @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **Linear Output white balance on 3-color CFA sensors** — a missing second green multiplier (X-Trans and similar) doubled the red and blue gains and cast exports magenta. @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **HQ preview no longer crashes on integrated GPUs** — a large scan was handed to the GPU with no size budget; integrated adapters get a conservative cap and downsample with a status message instead. @TobbyTravel
- Fix: **Enter stays on Scan in the live-view popup** — pressing Retake once made Enter keep retaking. @TobbyTravel
- Fix: **Copy Settings + Bounds pastes its bounds** — the per-frame floors, ceils and lock state never reached the target and a pasted bounds field wiped the target's own; the paste picker now lists them as "Normalization bounds".

## 0.55.0

- New: **Nikon Coolscan scanning through nkscan** — drives a Coolscan directly instead of through SANE: frame rectangles measured off the film in one pass, a native IR pass, native eject and the driver's own "ICE" dust removal, Samples, Superfine, Film type and Film format controls gated on what the unit advertises.
- New: **OpticFilm 8100 V2 support** — the Scan tab is no longer pinned to the 8200i SE; controls follow each device, with multi-exposure on both and no IR channel on the 8100 V2. @TobbyTravel
- Change: **GPU frames and tiled exports do less host work** — the meter reuses its prefiltered grid instead of re-partitioning it, and the paper buffer is skipped when there is no border to draw. Export bytes are unchanged.
- Change: **Plustek Scan tab hides controls the pyopticfilm backend does not use.** @jboneng
- Fix: **Camera connection no longer segfaults on unpopulated gphoto2 widgets** — a NULL value returned for a widget crashed the app. @fivedots
- Fix: **Exports tag an absolute resolution** — TIFF and PNG read as 1 DPI in Preview and fell back to 72 in Photoshop; every format now tags the DPI its own long edge implies, and both metadata rewrite paths carry it through. @Icodextrin
- Fix: **Linear Output no longer crashes on a camera DNG** — a stale early branch also skipped RGB triplets, flat-field, sensor correction and white balance. @Icodextrin
- Fix: **Stale source-camera EXIF is stripped on export** — a camera's own ColorSpace tag and its source-relative preview pointers contradicted the file's real color tag, making strict readers report the export untagged and refuse to preview it. @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **Batch Analysis measures the assembled composite** — an RGB triplet or an HDR merge was measured on one exposure alone, which inverted the other channels to black and left a solid red roll. @seanharding
- Fix: **Camera scanning keeps the PTP claim its identify probe wins** — releasing it let macOS's camera daemon take the interface for minutes, so the next live view or scan was refused; transient open failures are retried instead of reported. @light-sntchr
- Fix: **The canvas HUD no longer lags one edit behind** — pills drawn from the config, such as the export color space, updated only on the next history-recording edit. @seanharding
- Fix: **The Film Strip says when a filter, not a load failure, emptied it** — a persisted Sheet filter that matched nothing left a blank strip under a full frame count; the tally now reads "0 of 36 frames · Keepers filter". @seanharding
- Fix: **The H&D chart no longer resizes on hover** — the probe row grew with a taller fallback font and took the pixels out of the chart.

## 0.54.0

- New: **Metadata presets** — save any set of metadata fields as a named preset and apply it from the Metadata panel; gear presets are replaced and convert automatically, and a preset's values are editable in the library. @Icodextrin
- New: **Development process and scan setup libraries** — saved recipes (developer, dilution, push/pull, time, temperature) and scan setups sit beside cameras, lenses and film stocks; the new fields reach XMP, EXIF, the metadata preview, filename templates and search as `devtime:`, `temp:` and `dilution:`. @Icodextrin
- New: **Preferences dialog** — app-wide settings in one place (⋯ menu, Ctrl+, or the macOS application menu), in three sections: Interface, Performance, and Session & Storage; nine `override.toml` keys gain a UI, and a key the file pins greys out its row and says so.
- Change: **Narrowband capture modes renamed** — Narrowband Scanner, Trichrome and Single-Shot Narrowband replace "RGB Scan", "true RGB scan" and "Trichrome Calibration" across the UI and the docs. @thetalkingdrum
- Change: **Modeless windows stay above the main window on macOS** — the export progress window, the crosstalk and exposure target editors and the Scanlight windows can no longer be buried. @seanharding
- Fix: **Shortcut labels use the platform's own notation** — macOS menus, tooltips and shortcut lists show ⌘C rather than Ctrl+C, and a rebound action shows its own key instead of the default. @seanharding
- Fix: **1:1 zoom no longer upscales the preview** — the layout pass stretched a preview decoded below the render size, so 100% was not one scan pixel per device pixel; cropped frames and a raised `preview_render_size` were worst hit. @seanharding
- Fix: **Trichrome exposures decode at a neutral white balance** — three unrelated as-shot gains were tinting the assembled image; Linear RAW is now locked for a triplet, where it has no effect. @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **Camera white balance is never folded into a narrowband capture matrix** — Negative Peek, the CPU transparency-transfer stage and the GPU shader all follow the same rule. @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **Apply white balance greyed for Trichrome and Single-Shot Narrowband** — a narrowband capture has no broadband scene for as-shot gains to describe, so the Linear Output bake is inert. @thetalkingdrum

## 0.53.0

- New: **Capture date and place** — a Metadata panel card for when and where a frame was shot, with a map picker; searchable as `shot:` and `place:`.
- New: **Peek Negative** — view the negative as loaded, un-inverted and un-toned, to judge exposure or color cast before any edits; color-managed so the orange mask reads correctly, and the density histogram splits into R/G/B and luminance while peeking. @seanharding @thetalkingdrum
- New: **NegPy gets a macOS menu bar** — Window (minimize, zoom, close, window list) and Help (tour, shortcuts, guide, update check, report an issue). @seanharding
- New: **Choose what sits on the toolbar** — drag to reorder the toolbar and the Favourites pickers, plus an Edit Toolbar… entry.
- New: **Mask tint steps aside while you adjust it** — Burn, Feather and Grade sliders are no longer judged through the tint overlay; overlapping masks fade too. @Icodextrin
- New: **Preview resolution is configurable** — `preview_render_size` under `[performance]` in `override.toml` sets the interactive preview's long edge, between the 1600 px default and a full HQ decode.
- New: **Single-shot scan preview** for scanners with no motorized frame feed (Plustek and similar) — a lightweight preview-and-crop dialog before the full scan. @cymbal221
- Change: **Export and preview performance** — batch export overlaps decode, render and encode across files instead of running them strictly in sequence; slider drags on Process and Sensor, and other worst-case interactions, no longer pay settled-frame cost.
- Change: **Canvas zoom reads real scan pixels** — 100% now means one scan pixel per screen pixel in every mode, and a HUD pill flags when 100% is showing an upscaled preview. @seanharding
- Change: **Save Edits action removed** — edits already autosave on every change, so the explicit command was redundant. @seanharding
- Fix: **Auto Crop and Batch Autocrop fixed across seven edge cases** — dark subjects, portrait frames in a batch run, slides with true-black shadows, RGB triplets and rolls with no bed to detect all crop correctly now. @seanharding
- Fix: **Exports round to the nearest level instead of truncating** — every export, and the canvas itself, was up to half a level too dark. @seanharding
- Fix: **RGB triplets group correctly regardless of filename order** — captures are grouped and verified by capture order and scene content, not filename sort, and a folder that assembles nothing now says why. @seanharding
- Fix: **Matrix/TRC ICC input profiles no longer double-apply their tone curve** — the bypass gate never fired, and the primaries transform is now built and applied correctly for D50-, D60- and D65-native profiles alike. @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **ETTR clipping no longer trusts a generic sensor white level** — camera-scan calibration used a camera's published ADC ceiling instead of its calibrated one, letting a saturated channel read as clean. @light-sntchr
- Fix: **A stitch or an HDR merge survives a folder switch** — composite membership is now stored independently of the open-file list. @seanharding
- Fix: **Metadata is carried into every export format** — JPEG XL and WebP previously dropped every field; punctuation NegPy writes now survives EXIF's 7-bit limit, and a JPEG XL source's own metadata is read correctly. @Icodextrin
- Fix: **Linear Output's triplet merge is clamped before it can overshoot** — ringing from the alignment warp could push values past 1.0 uncaught in the float32 decode path.
- Fix: **Linux app icon resolves correctly** — follows the AppImage icon-theme spec, and fixes the taskbar icon under Wayland compositors. @kinnajowa
- Fix: **EXIF parsing no longer runs inside a `finally` block** — a malformed block silently returned empty metadata instead of surfacing the real error. @MohammedAlkindi
- Fix: **IR TIFF sidecar description no longer carries the source filename.** @MohammedAlkindi

## 0.52.0

- New: **Contrast Mask** — the darkroom's unsharp mask in the Tone panel: a blurred low-gamma sandwich that compresses or opens the global range while fine detail passes through. Works both ways, and its reach is drawn as a violet band on the H&D chart.
- New: **Tilt and Swing** — perspective correction as the enlarger's easel movements; tilt straightens converging verticals, swing converging horizontals. Nothing before this moved a converging line.
- New: **Unsplit diptych** — right-click a split half-frame scan in the filmstrip to get one plain frame back. Destructive and behind a confirm; both halves' edits, undo history and work prints go.
- New: **Manual update check** — a button beside the version number runs the release check on demand, instead of once per launch behind an unbound shortcut.
- New: **Nix flake** — build and run NegPy with Nix. @activexray
- Fix: **Auto Crop exports the crop you saw** — detection ran inside every render, so a preview and a full-resolution export could find different edges. The rect is now detected once and stored, the crop tool opens on it, and dragging it takes ownership. @seanharding
- Fix: **A composite frame is never a diptych** — an RGB Scan triplet, a stitch or an HDR merge could render split down the middle and half width if its file had been worked on as two halves earlier. Turning Half Frame on and off also left an untouched frame stuck that way. @seanharding
- Fix: **Only a scan you split comes back split** — a stale `#1`/`#2` settings row was enough to declare any whole scan a diptych, at half width with a dead controls panel. Existing pairs render whole again and keep their edits.
- Fix: **Windows self update survives a non-ASCII path** — the swap script garbled under a profile name with an accented character, so nothing installed and the app did not restart. @MohammedAlkindi

## 0.51.1

- New: **Before/After is a draggable split** — the baseline stays on the left of a divider you drag, the edit on the right, both live while you work, instead of a flash of the baseline that dropped back on the next edit.
- New: **A half-frame scan renders as a diptych with the split off** — turning the mode off no longer hides the two halves' saved edits; each half renders under its own config and the two are joined back into the original frame. Read-only, and exports as one `-DIPTYCH` file.
- Change: **Reverse Scroll Zoom sits in the canvas toolbar overflow menu** — it was a checkbox in the Customize Shortcuts dialog that only saved on OK. It now applies on click and can be given a key.
- Fix: **Thumbnail generation no longer crashes or exhausts memory** — a folder of scanner DNGs could segfault on an embedded bitmap thumbnail, and generating a large folder's thumbnails could grow until the kernel killed the app.
- Fix: **Linear Output follows the Export panel's destination rules** — "Same as source", "Subfolder of source" and the filename template were ignored, and the Destination section was hidden under the Linear intent. An unset export path also made Export do nothing without a message. @seanharding
- Fix: **A render that lands after you leave its frame is dropped** — a late render repainted the canvas with the wrong picture on CPU, blacked it out on GPU, and left the histogram, densitometer and UV grid describing the frame you had left. @seanharding
- Fix: **RGB triplet mode no longer opens solid red** — an assembled triplet inherited the red exposure's saved normalization bounds, measured when green and blue held only sensor leak, so those two channels inverted to black. @seanharding
- Fix: **File pickers open in a folder related to the work** — an empty row of the Edit RGB Triplet dialog, the flat-field reference picker and the three sensor calibration bands started at the root of the disk; they now start beside their siblings or at the last opened folder. @seanharding
- Fix: **An unusable user directory is reported, not a Qt abort** — a path NegPy cannot create killed the process with "Must construct a QApplication before a QWidget". It now names the directory, the errno and what to change. A leading `~` in `NEGPY_USER_DIR` is expanded. @seanharding
- Fix: **Cancel or X in the half-frame dialog reverts the toggle** — the switch stayed on after you dismissed the dialog. @emre155

## 0.51.0

- New: **Plustek OpticFilm 8200i SE over USB** — a native backend drives the scanner directly, no SANE, and the Scan tab is now enabled on Windows. Pre-scan with a crop box, two-pass IR aligned to the RGB scan, and Autofocus, Auto-exposure and bit depth shown only where the scanner reports them. The driver is its own project, [pyopticfilm](https://github.com/jboneng/pyopticfilm). @jboneng
- New: **Render Exposure slider (HDR Slides)** — a merged bracket's exposure is now continuous, 0 EV to −4 EV in the Process panel, because a bracket a stop apart rarely contains the exposure that looks right. The right-click menu still snaps to a captured frame; setting one clears the other. The merge is cached without the exposure applied, so dragging costs one multiply rather than a re-decode. @seanharding
- New: **Unload from the canvas right-click menu** — already on the toolbar overflow and the thumbnail menu, now on the image itself; same confirm, same saved edit kept. @thetalkingdrum
- Change: **A control that cannot apply grays out with the reason** — Narrowband and sensor unmix on a transparency (RGBScan.icc characterizes narrowband capture of negative dyes, and the unmix corrects for narrowband light, so neither means anything on a slide), and Normalize on a merged bracket (the stretch meters the frame and divides the merge's Render Exposure straight back out). They stay visible instead of disappearing while still live — the settings are sticky, and a hidden live setting could only be cleared by switching mode back. Unmerging restores Normalize. @seanharding
- Change: **The SANE dependency group is now `sane`** — `scanner` no longer named what it installs, now that the Plustek and PIEUSB backends ship. The install hints name the group, which a plain `uv sync` never installed.
- Change: **The in-app guide covers every panel** — the tour picks up Alternative Processes and the Process panel's Calibration section, and the steps that had drifted from the controls they describe were corrected. The User Guide behind each panel's ⓘ was rewritten shorter along with it.
- Fix: **Auto Crop takes the shape of the frame it found** — Ratio now defaults to Free, so a detected 35mm, 645, 6x6, 6x7 or 6x17 keeps its own shape instead of a 6x6 cut to a 3:2 strip; picking a ratio still forces every frame to it. Each edge is read line by line and out to 10% of a side, so a holder mask, a clear rebate, a sprocket rail or a neighboring frame gets trimmed instead of left as a bright band, and a blown highlight beside the subject is no longer mistaken for the light bed. A frame whose picture runs to its own edge is still bounded at 3%. @seanharding
- Fix: **Batch Autocrop judges each frame on its own evidence** — trim, placement and deskew came from the roll consensus, which left some rolls uncropped and straightened the most crooked frames to the roll median. Tilt is not a roll property; residual tilt across five test rolls drops to a hundredth of a degree. @seanharding
- Fix: **A bracket's ratios are solved on one white balance** — the merge pins every frame to the primary's, but the solve that produces the ratios did not, so a camera left on auto white balance gave each frame its own multipliers and skewed the result. Visible only with Normalize on. @seanharding
- Fix: **Slides stay positive in the film strip** — batch thumbnails re-detected the film process from an 8-bit preview, and warm content (sunset, skin, autumn) tripped the orange-mask test, so some transparencies appeared inverted until clicked. The frame's saved mode now decides; detection runs only where nothing has. @seanharding
- Fix: **Batch export finishes past a composite** — a stitched or merged frame carries a `#stitch` / `#hdr` suffix, which the half-frame lookup read as a number and raised on. One composite in the visible set stopped the whole run, ordinary frames included. @seanharding
- Fix: **A damaged thumbnail no longer stops the app** — a truncated cache entry (a kill or a full disk during the write is enough) passed the header check, then broke on the UI thread on that frame and on every launch after. It is now decoded before it is served, so a bad entry is a miss that regenerates. @seanharding
- Fix: **ICC color management is back on Flat and Print exports** — 16-bit TIFF/JXL exports shipped unmanaged on macOS arm64, silently, taking any custom Input/Output profile with them. @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **A crop handle can be grabbed wherever the cursor says it can** — the hover cursor hit-tests by distance, but the press had to land inside the image, so a handle on the frame edge looked live and would not move. With a print border on, no handle of a full-frame crop could be grabbed at all. @seanharding
- Fix: **Camera scanning reads shutter labels that carry their unit** — a Nikon's own ladder was dropped, and NegPy no longer writes a shutter speed the body has not published. @light-sntchr
- Fix: **Resource paths on Windows** — generated install scripts carried backslash paths and resource lookups mixed separators. @MohammedAlkindi

## 0.50.0

- New: **Merge exposures (HDR)** — select several captures of one slide in the film strip and right-click → **Merge exposures (HDR)** for a single frame carrying the whole density range; **Unmerge exposures** puts the originals back. Ratios are measured from the pixels, since several scanner formats carry no shutter tags, and the frames are registered in case the camera shifted. **Render exposure** picks which shot the merge opens at — the reference is usually one to three stops brighter than the frame you metered, so the exposure you want is below what *(as captured)* points at. Offered on transparencies only: a color negative holds 5-6 stops between base and Dmax and a B&W negative nearer 4, both inside a single capture, where a transparency runs to 10-12. @seanharding
- New: **Transparencies render as captured** — Normalize now defaults to off, so a slide opens looking the way it does in Photoshop, Preview or Darktable, and a bracketed set stays a bracket: the camera's own color matrix is applied and the exposure window is fixed to the decoder's white level, with no metering at all. Print controls give way to a plain transfer curve — Density, Grade, Toe, Shoulder, plus Shadows and Highlights Density, the only mid-sparing tone controls on that path — which is exactly the identity at its defaults. Coming from Lightroom: Exposure is Print Density, Contrast is ISO-R Grade, and the other two are Shadows and Highlights, in darkroom sign, so negative Shadows Density opens the shadows. Normalize is unchanged and one click away: it meters a per-frame stretch, which is right on faded film but reads washed out on a slide exposed as intended. Saved edits keep whatever they were saved with. @seanharding
- New: **Alternative Processes panel** — with a None / Lith / Cyanotype selector, B&W only and off by default. Lith over-exposes the paper and snatches the print part-way through infectious development: Exposure, Snatch Point and Abruptness. Its color has no slider — it comes from the paper, so Fomatone liths warm and colorful and Ilford Multigrade barely liths. A cyanotype prints on Exposure Scale, the negative density range the sensitiser prints, so a longer scale prints softer; Sensitiser (Classic or New) picks the Dmax and the color path, and bleach plus tannin gives the split blue-brown. Selenium and gold behave the way they do on real lith silver; on a cyanotype there is no silver at all, so the silver toners are skipped and greyed out.
- New: **Transport Line tool** — one click traces a long transport scratch and repairs it. Such a scratch is far too faint at any single point to separate from grain, so the evidence is integrated along the line and the line's own slope is fitted rather than assumed. Only the stretches where the ridge persists are repaired, and Line Sensitivity trades reach against picking up the film either side, on lines already placed as well as new ones.
- New: **Install an update from inside the app** — the Update Available notice now opens a window with the release notes, the download size and one button: NegPy fetches the build matching how this copy was installed, closes, installs over the old version and reopens on the new one. Where it cannot swap itself — a source checkout, a platform with no build — the button opens the releases page. @Aa0rR
- New: **Reflecta and Pacific Image scanners without SANE** — a native pieusb backend drives them directly, with autofocus, auto or manual exposure and per-phase progress. It ships on Windows too. @davide-b
- New: **Composite badges on the film strip** — a stitch, a merged bracket, an RGB triplet and a half-frame split each carry a corner glyph and a tooltip naming the frame count, so the contact sheet says what a frame is built from without the right-click menu.
- New: **Multi-core CPU rendering is now togglable** (canvas toolbar → **»**) — previously it was on for Linux and Windows but disabled on macOS due to stability issues. Now it's opt-in on macOS. @seanharding
- Change: **Process modes renamed** — the picker, the HUD pill and the settings dialog now say Color Negative, B&W Negative and Transparency instead of the chemistry codes C41, B&W and E-6. Saved edits, sticky settings and crosstalk profiles carrying the old strings keep loading.
- Change: **Setup tab rearranged** — the film mode is now three buttons above the panels, colored per process, so the first choice of every edit is always in sight instead of inside a collapsible. Linear RAW, Narrowband and the scanning-setup bulb move to Calibration, beside the other capture corrections; the Process panel keeps what is left and is renamed **Normalization**, with Lock Bounds beside the analysis buffer it freezes. Presets moves to the bottom of the tab.
- Change: **Crosstalk matrices declare their film process** — a matrix describes one dye set, so a profile now carries `process` and only appears, and only applies, in the film it was made for. The in-app editor gains a Process control and stamps new matrices with the mode in use.
- Change: **Cast Removal is hidden outside color negative** — the solve needs shadow and neutral-axis references that are measured for C-41 only, so on a slide or a B&W frame the slider moved a value the render never read. It defeats the orange mask, which is a manufactured cast; a slide's cast is the photograph. Use Temperature, the CMY sliders or Hue Trim there instead.
- Change: **Folders open faster** — importing hashes files across cores instead of one at a time, and the film strip fills in as thumbnails are made rather than staying blank until the whole batch ends. Half-frame split detection and RGB-triplet classification run across cores too.
- Fix: **Film strip thumbnails show the right frame, right way up** — a finished render is now filed under the frame it started from rather than whatever is selected when it lands, so clicking ahead during a decode, switching folders or merging a bracket no longer leaves the wrong picture cached across restarts. Batch thumbnails are inverted too, so triage no longer runs against a sheet of orange negatives. @seanharding
- Fix: **Heal and Scratch repairs keep the film around them** — healed specks came back as dark crescents and scratch strokes left wide dark bands. Every repair — IR, detected specks, painted strokes — now takes the same score-weighted fill on the linear source, so a dark defect is no longer vetoed by a gate meant for bright dust, and clean film under a generous brush comes back byte-identical.
- Fix: **Linear Output no longer freezes the app, and reads a DNG's own calibration tags** — it looped on the GUI thread with no progress, no abort and no cursor, and runs on the export worker now, with a batch of failed sidecar writes no longer reported as a success. The 3-channel LinearRaw decode also divided by the container's bit depth and ignored BlackLevel, WhiteLevel and LinearizationTable, so a DNG whose real white point sits well below the container max exported about 20x too dark. @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **Export follows the panel and the whole frame** — batch export took sizing, quality and the filename pattern from whatever export block each frame carried when it was last saved, so a frame saved while the panel was on Pixels/2000 exported at 2000 px however the panel was set, and the two "all visible" scopes collapse into one. Exporting the current file built a bare asset entry, so a narrowband triplet exported as its primary exposure alone instead of the merged RGB. @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **DNG 1.7 JPEG-XL linear RAW files import** — DxO PhotoLab, PureRAW and Lightroom Enhance write files libraw's published wheels cannot unpack, which crashed the import. NegPy now decodes the LinearRaw SubIFD itself, and steps aside if a future rawpy build can do it natively. @cymbal221
- Fix: **A Nikon High Efficiency NEF says why it cannot be opened** — HE and HE* files keep the `.NEF` extension and parse cleanly, then failed at the pixels as "Unsupported file format or not RAW file", which reads as a corrupt file. NegPy now names the format and suggests re-shooting in Lossless Compressed or converting to DNG; decoding them is not possible without the licensed codec. @seanharding
- Fix: **Counts read as English** — fifteen messages used the "(s)" shortcut, from the session-restore prompt to batch export and scan progress, so a single item read as unfinished. They now say "1 file" or "3 files", with the verb agreeing. @seanharding
- Fix: **The import popup stays quiet while Hot Folder polls** — each new frame started its own hashing and thumbnail batch, so a tethered session got a popup over the canvas on every shutter release. Quick imports report in the status line instead; abortable batches still show it. @MarinChen99097
- Fix: **Interface gaps closed** — a long status message wraps instead of running off the canvas, and the session toolbar measures its own contents, so buttons no longer go into the overflow menu sooner than the width requires; macOS dialog buttons stop underlining a letter that does nothing, Alt+letter unchanged on Windows and Linux (@seanharding). Slider keyboard shortcuts post their value to the HUD, and Show Slider Values pins every box open. Calibration and Flat Field join the modified-count sync, so their headers count, their reset buttons appear and their tabs light. Deleting a work print, roll or flat-field profile asks first, a blank rename is ignored, and the Scan panel gets the combo wheel guard it never had; scrolling over one changed scanner settings.
- Fix: **Slider shortcuts stop at controls the panel has retired** — the keys fired from any tab and never asked whether the slider was live, so Temperature still moved on a B&W frame and White Point still moved under Lock Bounds. A greyed-out or mode-hidden control now ignores its shortcut and the HUD names it instead of a value; a control that is only on another tab or in a collapsed section still answers. Favourites mirrors of a mode-hidden slider are hidden as well.

## 0.49.0

- New: **Oval and card-edge dodge/burn masks** — a mask can now be an oval (burn through a hole in the card) or a gradient (the graduated card-edge ramp), and any mask can be inverted to print outside its own shape. Handles may sit off the frame, so a tilted edge holds a whole corner. Old saves load as polygons.
- New: **JPEG XL** — lossless JXL files load as sources, and Linear, print and flat exports can write standalone lossless JXL, with an effort slider and a matching IR sidecar. TIFF stays zlib-only; JXL cannot carry an arbitrary ICC profile, so its color tagging is limited to sRGB/P3/Rec 2020/Greyscale. @thetalkingdrum
- New: **Sticky Zoom** — keeps the current zoom level when you move to another frame instead of resetting to fit-to-window; toolbar overflow menu, canvas right-click menu or a bindable shortcut, and it survives restarts. @thetalkingdrum
- New: **Immersive Canvas** — off, fit-to-window reserves room for the floating toolbar so the pill never sits on the picture. Persists across sessions. @thetalkingdrum
- Change: **Preview is much faster** — a drag frame drops 135ms → 12ms, and an HQ drag frame 5.6s → 11ms. Stage skipping now really runs, autocrop, flat-field and the dodge/burn map are cached, the soft proof rides the display LUT, and a live gesture renders against a preview-size proxy. Releasing the slider still renders the full frame, and the last eight rendered frames are kept, not two, so navigating back repaints at once.
- Fix: **Sharpening now applies to the exported pixels** — the unsharp radius scaled with the pipeline, so 1 px became a ~6 px blur on a 24 MP export and read as contrast. Radius is in output pixels on both paths, and export downscales are area-correct. Judge sharpening at 1:1.
- Fix: **IR capture on scanners that switch source** — Plustek and Epson-class flatbeds kept the Capture IR checkbox disabled although the scan path worked; the two passes are also aligned to each other and each reports its own progress. @cymbal221

## 0.48.1

- New: **Printing Notes** — Export tab previews a marked-up work print on canvas (Shift+N) and writes it as `<stem>_notes.jpg`: burns hatched, dodges open, masks badged in stops, print recipe below. Normal exports aren't annotated.
- New: **Local Grade per dodge/burn mask** — each mask can print at its own contrast, in ISO-R points off the frame's Grade. Burn a sky in through a harder filter.
- Change: **Dodge/burn now in stops** — the mask slider is "Burn", ±2 stops, default 0; positive burns, negative dodges. Old saves migrate.
- Fix: **Slider tooltips work on the label too** — hovering a slider's title showed only "double-click to reset" instead of what the control does. Both halves now show the full text.

## 0.48.0

- Change: **Calibration section** — the sensor unmix, the crosstalk matrix and Hue Trim now sit together, out of Process, since all three correct the capture rather than the negative-to-positive conversion. Crosstalk is reframed as a property of a whole scanning setup rather than of a film stock; the bundled matrices are marked "(approx)" and grouped by provenance, and "Default" is now "Generic C41".
- New: **Hue Trim** — a ±30° rotation of the print's colors about the neutral axis, for a narrowband-ish or odd-phosphor light that rotates hues instead of casting them, where white balance has no grey to correct. Sticky across frames, since the light is a rig property.
- New: **Scanner formats as Linear Output sources** — Coolscan NEF, Flextight FFF (including LogLuv-encoded), Noritsu RAW and generic TIFF, the last with an Input gamma selector for files whose encoding is tagged wrong. @thetalkingdrum
- New: **Composites and correction toggles in Linear Output** — RGB-scan triplets merge into one TIFF and stitch composites assemble per part; optional WB, flat-field and sensor-correction checkboxes bake those into camera RAW exports, all off by default. @thetalkingdrum
- New: **IR dust removal in Linear Output** — bakes the frame's IR correction (NegPy or OpenICE) into the written file; shown only when the source carries an IR channel. @thetalkingdrum
- New: **Half-frame rectangle editor** — turning on Half Frame opens an editor on the current scan: a crop box, a draggable split line and a Cut thickness slider for the black separator band. The setting is saved and reused for every half-frame split; Adjust Half Frame reopens it. @diegotonetti99
- Fix: **Linear Output batch export uses each file's own settings** — the current frame's RGB-scan, stitch, flat-field and process config was applied to every file; the XMP also gains dc:title so Bridge shows the description, and drops the RAW-WB gains when WB is baked in. @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **OpenICE repairs keep the film's grain** — solid dust leaves nothing to rebuild from, so the patch came back glassy against the film around it; ICE's own dither is back, drawn from pixel coordinates so a banded pass matches a whole-frame one.
- New: **Scanner exposure slider** — appears in the Scan tab when the SANE backend exposes `scan-exposure-time`, and stays hidden on devices without it. @diegotonetti99
- New: **Clickable canvas empty state** — "Load some scans to get started" is now a button offering Add files / Add folder. @linkmodo
- Fix: **Session panel stays stacked with every section collapsed** — leftover height spread into the gaps between toolbar, filter row and headers.
- Fix: **Canvas empty state stays centred** — it tracked the window, so hiding a dock left it drifting off to one side. @linkmodo
- Change: **Sidebar branding folds away** — logo and version collapse behind a chevron, remembered across launches. @linkmodo

## 0.47.0

- New: **Work prints** — save the live edit under a name from the History tab (Ctrl+Shift+S); click one to make it live, right-click to export, rename or delete. They outlive undo and an edit made after stepping back.
- New: **Library folders and metadata search** — a tree of your own roots above the film strip, browsable without loading a thing, plus one query language (`film:portra iso:>=400 -rejected:`) that either filters the loaded roll or searches folders on disk. Ctrl+L opens the library, Alt+Up walks up. Searching an archive is a directory walk, not a hash pass.
- New: **A third zone-placement pin** — places a mid tone as well as the two extremes, solving one knee control (Shadows Grade, Highlights Grade or Snap) chosen by which of them measurably moves that pin; when the asks conflict the readout reports where the pins actually land.
- Fix: **Camera scanning crash on Canon EOS** — the event queue is no longer drained before the first capture; white-light captures also stop inheriting the RGB preset's shutter. @light-sntchr
- Fix: **Opening a folder selects the first frame in filmstrip order** — discovery order landed mid-strip once the strip sorted by name or date. @seanharding
- Fix: **GPU test strip and color ring-around previews render** — alpha is stripped before RGB888 display. @jboneng
- Fix: **No history step for an edit that changes nothing** — re-applying identical settings pushed dead rows and discarded the redo branch.

## 0.46.0

- New: **Zone placement** — click a cell in the Analysis zone strip, click that spot on the photo, and Print Density (one pin) or Density and ISO-R Grade (two pins) solve so it prints there; pins drag live and Apply is one undo step.
- New: **OpenICE IR removal** — a Method choice in the IR Removal panel: a port of [openICE](https://github.com/a6o/openICE), a reverse-engineering of Nikon Scan's Digital ICE, that rebuilds fine structure band by band where the existing chain averages it away, with its levels measured per frame instead of fixed to one scanner.
- New: **Skin Protection** — a soft chroma ceiling on skin in the Lab panel, applied after the Chroma scale and independent of it, so skin that came off the print curve already sunburnt is reined in too. On by default at 0.5.
- New: **Scanning setup wizard** — camera or scanner, white light or narrowband RGB; sets Linear RAW and Narrowband for the whole session. Opens after the first-launch tour, reachable from the bulb in the Process panel.
- New: **Favourites panel** — a tab holding the sliders you reach for most, in your own order; each mirrors the real control and keeps its mode gating.
- New: **Linear Output export** — a third export intent that skips the pipeline and writes the decoded source (Pakon, LinearRaw DNG, camera RAW) as an untagged linear 16-bit TIFF, WB recorded rather than applied. @thetalkingdrum
- New: **Stitching accepts RGB-scan triplets** — each part decodes against its own green/blue exposures instead of the primary's. Also fixes RGB Scan / Half Frame dropping a composite's other parts.
- New: **Metadata and capture roll/frame in export filename templates** — new tokens for both, frame numbers zero-padded, and roll/frame written to the negpy XMP namespace when set. @jboneng
- New: **Selectable EXIF ImageDescription fields** — choose which process and scanning values are written, with a live preview; the selection sticks across frames. @jboneng
- New: **Busy cue while the IR bake runs** — a toast for an uncached IR bake or hair inpaint, held until the frame lands; cache hits stay silent.
- Change: **Flat-field profiles are self-contained** — baked to their own file store, so moving or deleting the reference image no longer silently drops the correction; legacy profiles migrate on launch. @seanharding
- Change: **Side panels narrow further** — button rows spill into overflow menus; minimum widths drop to 92px (controls) and 170px (session).
- Change: **Film strip scrolling** — eased wheel scrolling, one row per notch, trackpads unchanged; right-clicking empty space opens Add files / Add folder / Clear all. @linkmodo
- Change: **Reset in the Filtration panel is icon-only** — lining its tool row up with the Tone panel's.
- Fix: **IR dust removal is more accurate on every scanner** — detection now runs at the scale it repairs, so exports stop upsampling the mask and printing dark blotches next to tonal edges; the dip landmarks adapt to weak-IR scanners (a Plustek/SilverFast HDRi DNG had most of its dust missed) while scanners at or above the reference render byte-identical; and repairs paste the frame's own grain back instead of a grainless average, so healed hairs no longer leave a dark line.
- Fix: **Every RAW decodes on one shared scale** — LibRaw rescaled to the frame's own brightest pixel once the film base neared clipping, putting normalization bounds, flat-field, crosstalk and A/B on different scales. @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **Arrow-key navigation lands on warm frames** — prefetch followed discovery order, not the filmstrip's sorted, filtered order. @seanharding
- Fix: **Tethered shots are deleted off the body after download** — bodies without a capture target (X-T5) hold every object and refuse the 13th capture. @light-sntchr
- Fix: **Two scans of one frame both open** — the content fingerprint samples the file's interior as well as its ends, so same-size scans no longer collide; existing edits, undo history and marks move to the new identity on launch.
- Fix: **Glow and halation export at the size the preview shows** — GPU radii scale with the render instead of being fixed, and CPU and GPU now weight the highlight mask the same way.
- Fix: **Bulk operations no longer stamp the active frame's edit onto untouched frames** — Batch Analysis, roll application, Sync and presets all start from the frame's own hydrated config. @seanharding
- Fix: **Export Sidecars writes each frame's own edit** — a frame with no saved edit got the active frame's whole look written to its `.negpy`, which later promoted into the database. @seanharding

## 0.45.0

- New: **Test strip** — the Tone panel prints the frame as a 5×5 grid, Print Density increasing left to right and ISO-R Grade softening top to bottom, each ladder centred on its default so the settings you already have are one of the patches, so the diagonals read light-to-dark and soft-to-hard like a split-filter test strip. Each patch is a real render at its own settings; click one to keep it. Escape or a second press clears it, and any edit drops it. A patch only shows the slice of the frame at its own slot, so either proof can be turned: while one is up the 90° rotate buttons and [ / ] rotate the ladder instead of the image, moving the dense/hard end onto a different part of the frame with the axis labels following. Printing assembles all four orientations off the one set of renders, so turning the ladder is instant.
- New: **Color ring-around** — the Filtration panel (or Shift+F) prints the frame as a 5×5 mosaic stepping 2cc at a time out to ±4cc on the magenta and yellow axes, so the direction of a color cast is visible instead of guessed. Each patch is a real render; click one to keep its filtration. Like the test strip the ladder is absolute and centred on neutral, so a ring printed off one frame compares to the next and picking a patch doesn't force a reprint. The two proofs share the canvas — asking for one while the other is up swaps it.
- New: **Dye Separation** — one density-space saturation control in the Tone panel (0.5 to 1.5), pushing the print's three dye densities apart inside the paper's own crosstalk matrix, so it answers to the paper profile you picked and eases off where the curve is already compressed at toe and shoulder; below 1.0 pulls the dyes toward neutral. Replaces Dye Mute and Lab Vibrance, with per-layer trims in R/G/B mode. @thetalkingdrum
- New: **Separation Damping** — decides where the Dye Separation push lands rather than adding one of its own: muted color keeps the full push while color that is already saturated gets the opposite, so a hard push fills the tones that had no color instead of flattening the strongest ones. Greyed out at Dye Separation 1.0, where it has nothing to redistribute.
- New: **Step wedge** — the Analysis panel gains a 21-step transmission wedge printed through the frame's current settings, under the curve chart, so you can see where the paper's scale runs out: which steps still separate, where the toe crushes them into paper black and the shoulder blocks them into paper white. The usable range is bracketed and the labels read in the scan's own density units. It shows the same curve the chart plots, from the same solved slope and pivot, so the two can't disagree.
- New: **Panel guides on every panel** — each control section's header gains an ⓘ opening that panel's section of the user guide inside the app, sliced from the doc itself so the two cannot drift; the Analysis panel gets a full walkthrough of the curve, step wedge, zone strip, probe and negative stats.
- New: **IR channel read from 64-bit HDRi RAW DNGs** — IR Removal now works on these files. @jboneng
- New: **Grain focuser** — Shift+L follows the cursor with a loupe showing the frame's own pixels at 2×, plus an acutance figure for comparing sharpness from one part of the frame to another. Pixels are magnified without smoothing, so running out of resolution looks like running out of resolution, and the badge says whether you are on preview or full resolution — it reads true with HQ Preview on.
- Change: **Lab Saturation renamed Chroma** — To describe what it does exactly in contrast to 'Dye Separation' - It's linear Chroma scaling after the "Print". Chroma Denoise moves alongside it in the Color row.
- Change: **Chroma pushes into the gamut instead of clipping at it** — color that used to overshoot and get hard-clamped per channel, shifting its hue, now eases in on a soft knee against each pixel's real headroom; skin-tone hues take a gentler push on boosts, and pulling chroma down is unchanged. @thetalkingdrum
- Change: **Crosstalk's Separation slider renamed Strength** — the pair under CROSSTALK now reads Matrix / Strength, to avoid confusion with Dye Separation in tone panel.
- Change: **Sensor profiles require Linear RAW** — profiles are calibrated on neutral-WB decodes, so with Linear RAW off the unmix overcorrected instead of degrading; the panel now shows None, greys out and says why. @seanharding
- Fix: **The Analysis chart plots the selected paper's own curve** — Endura and Crystal Archive print deeper than the default paper black, but the chart drew the default curve for every profile, so the plotted shadows were off by up to 0.01 in code value from the print they described.
- Fix: **The crosshair and brush ring no longer linger after the cursor leaves the canvas** — most visible when the pointer exits over the floating toolbar, which sits inside the image.
- Fix: **Auto crop no longer leaves the rebate on tightly framed scans** — each frame measures its own borders and falls back to the roll median only where it cannot, and the deskew angle is fitted to the film edge instead of a thresholded blob; detection on the reference roll went from 4 of 72 frames to 71. @seanharding
- Fix: **IR Removal no longer mottles clean film** — the clean-film level is measured per frame, so a scanner with a noisy IR plane no longer trips the fallback that lifted the whole negative.
- Fix: **Settings pickers can apply defaults** — Apply Settings, Paste Settings and presets list settings sitting at their default behind a "Show unchanged settings" toggle, so a value can be pushed back to 0 across a roll.
- Fix: **Contact-sheet tiles render at proof scale** — each tile ran the pipeline at full resolution and threw most of it away, spiking several GB per frame and dropping tiles; peak memory is now flat across a roll. @linkmodo
- Fix: **The BEFORE badge stays in sync with the frame on screen** — on a slow render it used to appear over the still-displayed edit. @seanharding
- Fix: **Camera scanning survives a broken live view** — a failed preview stream no longer ends the capture session, and late post-shot events are drained before each preview restart. @light-sntchr
- Fix: **_IR TIFF sidecars hidden from the contact sheet.**
- Fix: **Panel guides open centred on the main window.**
- Fix: **Zoom buttons aligned with the rest of the canvas toolbar.** @seanharding

## 0.44.0

- New: **Zone system overlay** — toggle Adams zones over the preview from the toolbar or Shift+Z; cells merge into regions with one Roman numeral each, paper black and white flagged red, and the ruler is shared with the sidebar zone strip and spot densitometer so the three never disagree. Peek Flat Scan moves to the overflow menu.
- New: **Filed carrier gains Flare and Corners** — light bounced off the filed bevel glows on the rebate and stains a new margin of unexposed paper (colored on color film, neutral in B&W), the aperture rounds off like a real file cuts it, and edge roughness picks up a 2-D field so the edge reads as torn metal rather than a wobbly line.
- New: **Clear cached thumbnails** — Manage Database… now reports the thumbnail cache's size and clears it on demand, regenerating for the loaded files afterwards; Reset Everything stays database-only.
- Change: **DNG dropped as an export format** — saved settings pointing at it now export 16-bit TIFF. DNG still works as an input format and as scanner output.
- Change: **Dye Mute defaults to 0.25** — less chroma damping on the default look.
- Fix: **Chroma denoise no longer blooms color across edges** — taps are now weighted by chroma similarity as well as distance, so a saturated object stops depositing color outside its own edge; flat areas still smooth fully. The slider is renamed Chroma Denoise, since it only touches a*/b*.
- Fix: **Glow and halation use the working space's luma weights** — both masks read Rec.709 weights against a scene-linear Adobe RGB buffer, on CPU and GPU alike. @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: **Pasted settings re-meter the frame** — pasting Analysis Buffer, Mode, Range, Color, Crosstalk, Sensor Calibration or the crop rows changed the stored value without changing the render until a crop or slider nudge forced re-analysis; applies to paste, apply-to-selection, apply-to-roll and preset apply.

## 0.43.1

- Fix: **Slider edits always reach the database** — a drag landing on the value another image last committed no longer skips saving; most visible on Crosstalk Separation, where the edit would revert on the next visit to the frame. @seanharding
- Fix: **Slider handling** — the handle no longer jumps back a step on release, left-click jumps it to the cursor, and near-miss clicks just above or below the groove now grab it. @seanharding
- Fix: **Filmstrip thumbnails for composite frames** — RGB-scan triplets show the merged color frame instead of the red-only exposure, and rendered thumbnails for triplets, half-frame splits and stitches are keyed by the asset's name, so the uninverted placeholder no longer sticks. @seanharding
- Fix: **Camera scanning without live view** — the camera's advertised abilities are checked before live view starts, and bodies with no preview stay usable for scanning. @light-sntchr
- Fix: **Intel macOS release builds** — the Intel build works again. @JKBusse

## 0.43.0

- Change: **Cast removal finds neutrals more reliably** — the neutral-axis estimator measures chroma hue-uniformly, recovers strong but correctable casts it used to reject outright, and weights its confidence by how many near-neutral pixels it found and whether midtones and shadows agree.
- Change: **Color bounds sample the dense end from near-neutral pixels** — one shared, chroma-gated pixel set instead of independent per-channel percentiles, so strongly colored highlights weigh less on channel balance; frames without trustworthy neutrals keep the percentile pass.
- Change: **Tutorial explains the Process and Tone panels properly** — new steps for film mode, RAW decoding and Lock Bounds, fuller detail on the bounds clips and per-layer white/black points, and Paper White, the per-layer trim sliders and the greyed global-only controls are covered at last.
- Fix: **Photometric curve chart matches the render** — the chart's per-channel curves are solved through the same path as the image, so confidence-weighted cast strength, the neutral axis and per-channel curvature now show up in the graph.
- Add configurable target architecture for DMG builds @JKBusse

## 0.42.0

- New: **Presets UX pass** — presets now live in a visible list (tooltips show contents), and Save, Edit and Apply all use the per-setting picker from copy/paste: a preset stores exactly the settings you tick, and applying shows them again with a choice of current frame, selection or whole roll, laid over existing edits or replacing the look. Per-frame crop, rotation, metadata, dust and masks are never touched; existing preset files keep working.
- New: **Sensor Calibration** — a 3×3 unmix profile, calibrated from three bare-light R/G/B exposures, corrects the channel bleed narrowband LED scans pick up through the sensor's color filters, applied to the linear capture before inversion. Profiles are saved per setup, default to None, and stay off for RGB-triplet composites (their channels are already separate exposures).
- New: **Selectable scanner backend groundwork** — a Backend dropdown in the Film Scanner panel picks the scan transport; SANE is the only one today, and more slot in through a registry.
- Fix: **Tool clicks no longer offset by the print border** — heal spots, dodge & burn masks and white-balance picks land where clicked when a border or paper size pads the preview; the crop tool's preview is no longer padded either.
- Fix: **IR sidecars matched case-insensitively** — infrared files named `_ir.tiff` (not just `_IR.tif`) are now detected, so IR dust removal works on scans from more tools.
- Fix: **Camera scan flags a dropped live view** — the scan and calibration windows now report a lost live-view session instead of stalling, and an invalid output folder is rejected before capture starts. @light-sntchr

## 0.41.0

- New: **Stitch multi-shot scans** — select overlapping shots of one frame (e.g. a 6×6 scanned in two halves) on the contact sheet and pick **Stitch selected frames**. Alignment, exposure matching and blending happen on the linear scan data before conversion, so the result develops like a single raw. No new file is written: the composite edits and exports like any frame, and **Unstitch** restores the parts. IR dust data is kept when all parts have it.
- New: **Manage Database…** — dialog to inspect and clear stored data; Clear Saved Edits or Reset Everything, both guarded. @linkmodo
- Change: **Copy/paste and Apply-to-roll are now per-setting** — instead of a handful of broad section checkboxes, pasting settings and **Apply settings…** open a picker that lists exactly the settings you changed on the source frame, grouped in collapsible sections (Tone, Color, Lab, Toning, Finish, Crop, Process, Retouch, Metadata, Export) with each value shown. Tick only what you want, hit Apply. Paste now pops the same picker (Ctrl+V) rather than replacing everything at once; per-frame things like dust spots, heal strokes and crop bounds are never overwritten.
- New: **Contact sheet labels and colors** — per-frame labels plus background/label color, saved as templates. @jboneng
- Change: **Bottom toolbar streamlined** — zoom slider removed, GPU/CPU toggle moved to the overflow menu, tooltips on every item; Before/After and Peak Flat are now mutually exclusive and survive rotate/flip. @linkmodo
- Change: **pieusb scans use NegPy's IR dust removal** — RGBI scan routed through NegPy's own dust removal instead of the scanner's. @hullrich
- Fix/Change: **Linear RAW now controls TIFF decoding** — TIFFs are no longer always degamma'd to linear when the sRGB tag is wrong.
- Fix: **RGB preset scans expose correctly** — framing light dimmed 3 stops, preset exposure asserted when the scan window opens, Scan gated until the writes land. @light-sntchr
- Fix: **Correct color profiles on every export format** — greyscale JPEG/WebP now tagged, ACES/XYZ fall back to the tagged working space, contact-sheet JPEGs embed sRGB. @linkmodo
- Fix: **Contact sheets no longer drop frames on large rolls** — tiles downsample to target size instead of holding every frame full-res in memory. @linkmodo
- Fix: **Saved export destination restored on reopen** — the Folder mode no longer resets to "Subfolder of source". @paulglover

## 0.40.0

- New: **Sharpening rebuilt — Radius, Masking and a new Deconvolution mode** — the Sharpen controls, now in their own section, gain a **Radius** slider (how fine or broad the sharpened detail is), a **Masking** slider (holds sharpening off flat areas like skies and skin so grain and noise stay quiet), and a **Method** dropdown: **Unsharp Mask** (the classic, now with halo suppression on high-contrast edges) or **Deconvolution** (Richardson-Lucy, which models the lens/scan blur in linear light to pull back genuinely soft detail). Existing edits keep their look on Unsharp Mask.
- New: **Nikon Coolscan support - foundation work** — Initial backend preparation for expanded support. Current implementation stil relies on SANE but it's now done via generic ScannerBackend protocol - in preparation for supporting projects reverse-engineering old Nikon drivers. Initial SANE implementation supports auto focus, auto exposure, 6-frame preview from SA-21 and 6-frame batch scans. IR scanning is also supported but with some hacks on SANE side.
**Mainline sane coolscan3 is buggy and has missing features, proper SA-21 spacing and & IR capture require you to build compiled sane backends until proper fixes are upstream - consider it feature for nerds for now :)**.
- Change/Fix: **IR dust removal rebuilt** — heal more defects, minimize dark halo around repairs, very dusty scans no longer silently disable IR cleaning, and hairs are reconstructed from the surrounding film instead of turning into clone blobs. Based on ideas from digital-fauxice (@rohanpandula). Existing edits load unchanged; IR-cleaned frames render better.
- Change/Fix: **Camera scanning is faster and clearer** — the R/G/B triplet cadence tightens (shorter, channel-purity-verified LED settle, with the next channel settling while the last shot's events drain), and a live roll now gives feedback: the capture progress bar sits below the view and tints per channel, a green flash confirms each capture, and scan pop-ups stay above the batch progress dialog. @light-sntchr
- Change: **More crosstalk adjustment range** — the Process panel's spectral-crosstalk matrix allows a wider range of manual adjustment.
- Change: **Rotate buttons are easier to tell apart** — Rotate CCW/CW reused the same circular-arrow glyphs as the Undo/Redo buttons beside them; they now use distinct page-with-rotation-arrow icons, a touch larger. @linkmodo
- Change: **Analysis Region shows when it's active** — the Freedraw Analysis Region button carries a small dot whenever a custom region is overriding the Analysis Buffer slider, so it stays obvious after the draw tool closes. @linkmodo
- Fix: **Preview and export sharpen the same** — the GPU preview used a fixed kernel that sharpened the wrong detail band at export scale, so a full-size export could look softer or harsher than the preview. Both paths now sharpen identically at every zoom and output size.
- Fix: **Filmstrip thumbnails matched canvas color + there is thumbnail size slider** — thumbnails double-applied the working→sRGB conversion the canvas already bakes in when soft-proofing, oversaturating them; both paths now share one color-transform. There is also additional control for thumbnail size so you can decide between single column of bigger thumbnails vs cramming more of them in more columns. **Warning: First launch might re-generate your thumbnails** @linkmodo
- Docs: **Expanded user guide** — [USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md) rewritten for the current tabbed layout, covering every panel and control (including the ones the old guide never mentioned) in the order the pipeline applies them.


## 0.39.0

- New: **Half Frame mode** — a toggle in the Session panel for half-frame cameras (Pentax 17, Olympus Pen…) whose scans hold two photos side by side. Each scan appears as two frames in the contact sheet, split automatically at the gutter between them; every half gets its own edits, its own exposure measurement, its own sidecar, and exports as `name_1` / `name_2`. Toggling off puts the scans back together without losing the per-half edits.
- New: **Set your own Auto Density and Auto Grade targets** — the autos used to aim at fixed numbers baked into the code, which suited one scanner and one taste. A **Set Targets** button next to the two toggles opens sliders for what they aim at: how bright the metered midtone prints, how punchy the roll comes out, and how far each meter is trusted (at zero you get a fixed setting for every frame, at full every frame is forced to the same key or contrast). The preview follows the sliders live, Cancel puts them back, and Restore Defaults returns to the shipped values. It's a calibration rather than an edit — it applies to every image, including ones you've already worked on, and is remembered between sessions.
- Change: Also **moved the default Auto Grade** to be slightly more contrasty.
- Change: **Update notice is now a link** — the "Update Available" banner under the logo is clickable and takes you straight to the GitHub releases page, with a download icon.


## 0.38.0

- New: **Finish panel — edge burn, filed carrier and print mats** — a new Finish panel finishes the print after crop: **Edge Burn** replaces vignette with a true exposure burn in stops (radial or, via Roundness, a rectangular card-burn), **Filed Carrier** prints the black rebate of a filed-out negative carrier with a roughened inner edge, and **Border** adds a mat with adjustable width and color, a bottom-weighted (window-mat) proportion, and a Match Paper White option that ties the mat color to the toned paper white instead of a picked color.
- New: **Tweaked infrared dust cleaning** — IR dust removal now uses ratio-normalized detection instead of raw-IR thresholding, catching dust it used to miss and losing the slider cliff that could flag the whole frame. A new **IR Restore** tier recovers the image hiding under semi-transparent dust so only the opaque cores get cloned, and a cycling **Overlay** button (Off / Spots / Marked / IR) shows exactly what auto and IR detection are catching, for tuning. B&W and Kodachrome scans are skipped.
- New: **Keep / Reject triage on the contact sheet** — cull a roll where you see it: `K` marks a frame as a keeper (small check badge), `Shift+X` rejects it (cross badge + dim). Rejected frames stay on the sheet but drop out of batch exports and sidecar writes; a Sheet filter (All / Keepers only / Hide rejected) sits next to Sort, a tally counts the roll, and marks persist across sessions.
- New: **Dye Mute** — a new Lab slider that mutes color in step with print contrast, the way paper dyes lose separation at hard grades.
- New: **Narrowband Scan** — scans lit by narrowband RGB LEDs can come out extra saturated compared to white light. A new Process-panel toggle corrects the preview and every export automatically; a custom Input ICC still takes precedence. Enabling RGB Scan mode now switches Narrowband correction on for you (both the current frame and as the default for new frames). The internal profile no longer clutters the ICC dropdowns.
- New: **Roll-aware Batch Autocrop** — Geometry can analyze every visible landscape frame together before Batch Analysis, using confident frames to calibrate weaker detections for more consistent camera-scan crops. It runs in the background with progress/cancel, preserves existing manual crops and ambiguous frames, and saves explicit per-frame crop and fine-rotation settings. The first release supports Image-only mode. @rohanpandula
- New: **Common crop ratios, tidier picker** — the crop Ratio dropdown drops the duplicate reversed entries (the tool already auto-orients a ratio to your drag) and gains the ones that were missing: 7:5 (5×7 print), 16:9, 16:10 and US Letter. Old saved ratios still display correctly. @linkmodo
- New: **Unreadable files get a badge** — a frame that fails to decode or thumbnail wears a red badge with the reason in its tooltip instead of sitting silently in the grid; clicking it retries, a successful load clears it.
- Change/Fix: **Default exposute/color tweaks** — Fixed a bug that resulted in mixing ProphotoRGB output space with AdobeRGB. Using full prophoto primaries at output results in unnaturaly saturated colors that are pain to correct. Now pipeline output is using AdobeRGB primaries which should result in most faithful and natural looking image. Existing edits will render a little different.
- Change: **True Black is now Paper Black** — the toggle is inverted and renamed: left off (the new default) it keeps blacks pure, exactly as before; turned on it shows the paper's own slightly-lifted maximum black instead. Existing edits keep their look.
- Change: **Roll-wide actions are undoable** — Batch Analysis, roll-baseline loads and "Apply settings" now write each affected frame's edit history: `Ctrl+Z` on any frame steps back to before the roll action. Reset Settings and preset loads are recorded the same way instead of bypassing the log.
- Change: **One grammar for the canvas tools** — first `Esc` clears in-progress points, second puts the tool down (fixes Esc going dead mid-draw); toolbar Undo matches `Ctrl+Z`; a stray click outside a tuned crop no longer wipes it. New keys: `Shift+S` Scratch, `Shift+B` Dodge & Burn, `Shift+R` Analysis Region, `|` flat-master peek (plus a toolbar button).
- Change: **Quieter canvas** — the "Rendering… / READY / Loading…" toasts are gone (the progress bar already covers that activity); the canvas-background swatches move into the More-actions menu as a checkable group that shows the active color, with a new pure White option; and committing a manual crop on a large file now shows a busy spinner instead of freezing silently. @linkmodo
- Change: **Leaner previews, faster frame switching** — preview-load memory is roughly halved (peak dropped from ~2.9 GB to ~1.6 GB on a 56 MP TIFF), and navigating back to a frame you've already seen is now instant, reusing its last render instead of processing it again. @linkmodo
- Change: **Naming and panel tidy-up** — visible labels standardize on "color", and the white-balance section is renamed **Filtration** so "Color" unambiguously means the Lab & Toning tab; Tone's four "Width" sliders become "Toe Width" / "Shoulder Width"; editing presets and contact-sheet templates can be deleted from their panels; the Roll Analysis section gets a header reset; drag-and-drop opens the first frame like Add Files.
- Fix: **CLAHE now renders the same everywhere** — the GPU preview and the CPU fallback used two slightly different local-contrast algorithms, so the same slider value could look noticeably different between them, worst at high strength. Both now run one identical algorithm on the CIELAB lightness channel: local contrast no longer over-saturates boosted areas, the preview predicts the export at every zoom level, and the effect at high strength is cleaner. Expect a subtle look shift on frames with CLAHE above zero.
- Fix: **Scanner TIFFs now develop exactly like their DNGs** — 16-bit TIFFs without an embedded color profile were wrongly treated as sRGB, so the same scan rendered and exported differently as TIFF and DNG. They now load as linear scanner data (existing ones will render slightly differently), and scanner-TIFF and JPEG thumbnails no longer appear nearly black.
- Fix: **Exact 16-bit color on export** — cross-space TIFF, DNG and JXL exports now color-manage through lcms2 at full 16-bit precision instead of a 3-D lookup table that drifted up to ~6% from the correct values; same-space exports keep full precision as before. @RP2
- Fix: **Camera auto-calibration converges** — per-channel ETTR calibration measured each frame against its own brightest pixel instead of an absolute reference, so it plateaued or drifted and never truly settled; the decode is now pinned to a fixed reference. A calibration that can't reach its target at the hardware limits now aborts early and saves nothing — with a pop-up telling you which way to move the aperture or ISO — instead of quietly saving a best-effort preset that misses. The bogus "0 °C" light readout is also hidden on RGB-only Scanlights that have no temperature sensor. @light-sntchr
- Fix: **The camera dot shows when another app holds the body** — on macOS, Preview/Photos/Image Capture can claim the camera so every scan attempt fails; the connection dot now turns red "Camera (in use)" with a hint to close the other app, clears itself the moment the body is free, and shows the camera's real model name (e.g. ILCE-7CM2) from the start. @light-sntchr
- Fix: **Paper Black sticks across frames** — it was the one toggle in its group that reset on every frame; it now carries to the next like the Snap, Auto Density, Auto Grade and Paper White toggles it sits beside.
- Fix: **Heals survive frame switches** — placing a heal or scratch and switching to another frame no longer discarded it; the edit now persists like every other canvas action. @linkmodo
- Fix: **Batch export honours the session's format** — exporting all saved frames now uses the delivery format and color space set for the session instead of a stale value left on individual frames from an earlier export. @RP2
- Fix: **Overflow menu keeps its entries** — the More-actions menu no longer drops items when you toggle a side panel off and the canvas widens. @linkmodo
- Fix: **Canvas toolbar stays visible on narrow windows** — it now collapses controls into the overflow menu adaptively instead of getting cut off when the viewport is small. @jboneng
- Fix: **Pin then reset restores the original layout** — resetting the panel layout returns panels to their original docked position and size. @jboneng
- Fix: **The H&D chart shows where zero is** — the analysis curve's grid stopped short of the axes, so a curve flat at black looked like it hovered above the bottom of the plot instead of sitting on it. The 0 and 1 grid lines are now drawn.
- Fix: **Hidden dodge & burn masks stay hidden** — a mask you hid came back visible as soon as you switched to another frame, and the hide state was lost on restart; it now sticks per frame and across sessions. @paulglover
- Fix: **Cast Removal strength sticks across frames** — the slider now carries to fresh files like True Black and Auto Density, since it's a workflow preference rather than a per-image look.

## 0.37.2

- New: **Drag to heal** — the Heal tool now paints while you drag: a plain click still heals a single spot, but click-and-drag sweeps a heal along the cursor and commits the whole path as one stroke (one undo, one render). @linkmodo
- Change: **Canvas UX polish** — Enter confirms and closes the crop like double-click; the heal brush, scratch pen and white-balance picker fall back to the normal arrow over empty canvas (and the floating toolbar stays on the arrow); the current-frame Export scope reads "Export Current Frame"; tooltips wait longer before popping; and the Windows scanner placeholder text no longer clips. @linkmodo
- Fix: **Camera Scanning follow-ups** — RGB-only Scanlights (v1–v3, no white LED) now light the live view from the preset's own R/G/B instead of going dark, with the W slider and white-light preset hidden on those bodies; reopening Live View no longer flashes the previous session's last frame; and a rotating `negpy.log` plus a catch for unhandled UI errors turns a hard crash into a non-fatal notice with an attachable traceback. @light-sntchr

## 0.37.1

- Fix: **export no longer crashes on non-ASCII film metadata** — a film format like `4x5` (with a `×`) or other non-Latin characters NegPy writes into the EXIF no longer aborts a JPG, TIFF or PNG export; they're safely substituted. @RP2
- Fix: **spot densitometer no longer crashes on file switch** — hovering the image to read densities while switching frames could abort the app; the readout now goes quiet during the transition instead. @linkmodo

## 0.37.0

- New: **Crosstalk matrix editor** — a Manage button beside the Process → Crosstalk dropdown opens an editor: browse the bundled matrices (read-only), make an editable copy, adjust the channel-mixing terms with live preview, and save your own profiles as `.toml` files in the NegPy/crosstalk folder.
- New: **Editable Dodge & Burn masks** — the panel lists every mask you've drawn; pick one to select it, then reshape it right on the canvas (drag a point to move it, click an edge to add a point, right-click a point to remove it) and tune its sliders — no need to redraw from scratch.
- New: **Straighten tool** — draw a reference line on the image (ruler button under Geometry → Alignment, key `L`) and the frame rotates to match: lines near horizontal level the horizon, lines near vertical plumb an edge. Composes with Fine Rotation and the crop rotation handles. @linkmodo
- New: **Iron Blue, Copper and Vanadium Green toners** on the Toning page (B&W only) — navy shadows, pink-to-brick red with weakened blacks, and green mids over black shadows.
- New: **Spot densitometer** — hover the image to read the pixel under the cursor: per-channel density above film base (ΔD), the print's reflection density, and its print zone (Zone V = 18% grey); a dot tracks the pixel along the H&D curve.
- New: **Zone strip** — a Zone System bar under the chart shows how much of the print falls in each zone (0–IX) and flags blocked shadows or blown highlights in red.
- Change: **Dust & healing overhaul** — Auto Dust, IR removal and the manual Heal tool now share one texture-preserving clone instead of the old smoothed fill: sources are matched to their surroundings, edges feather with brush size, the halo around auto-fixed spots is gone, and hairs and scratches are traced along their length. Detection runs once on the source scan, so the fixed set no longer shifts as you drag sliders and preview heals exactly the spots export does. Auto Dust now works on E-6 slides too.
- Change: **Analysis chart redesign** — the histogram and the H&D curve merge into a single graph: the print's RGB histogram sits behind the curve, and a second grey histogram along the exposure axis shows where the negative's densities land on the paper curve — how much of the image rides the toe, the straight line or the shoulder, live as you drag Grade or Density (the LIN/LOG toggle scales both). The stats below reduce to the essentials: the negative's density range with a development read (flat / normal / contrasty), exposure in EV, and clipping — the scan-clip warning appears only when the scan actually clips.
- Change: **Heal & Scratch tools work fully on the canvas** — right-click opens a tool menu (Undo/Clear, Confirm Scratch, and Delete This Heal on a placed patch), the Scratch tool shows a pen cursor, `Ctrl+Z` undoes the last heal and Backspace steps back a scratch point; the two tools are now mutually exclusive and suspend/restore when you leave and return to their tab. The placed-heal outline no longer sits slightly offset from where you clicked. @linkmodo
- Change: **Toner combinations simulate sequential baths** — silver claimed by one toner is locked to the ones after it: selenium before sepia protects the shadows, partial sepia plus iron blue splits green. Single-toner looks are unchanged.
- Change: **Smoother masks and scratch heals** — Dodge & Burn mask outlines and Scratch heal strokes now follow smooth curves through their points instead of straight segments, and the line previews curved as you draw it.
- Change: **Fine Rotation now reads clockwise-positive** — dragging the slider (or the crop handles) to the right turns the image clockwise on screen, the photographer's convention, under every flip. Saved rotations render exactly as before. @linkmodo
- Change: **Customize Shortcuts redesign** — shortcuts are grouped into collapsible sections with one shortcut per row, slider rows merged with per-control keyboard step sizes, and a search box to jump to an action; the read-only shortcut overview gets the same press-to-search lookup. @jboneng
- Change: **Camera Scanning presets lock the whole exposure** — a preset now stores the ISO and aperture the film base was metered at alongside the RGB levels and shutter, and re-asserts all of them before every shot, so a bumped dial between scans can't skew a scan. @light-sntchr
- Change: **Snappier camera live view** — stepping ISO / shutter / aperture waits for you to pause before writing to the body instead of firing a slow write per click, so rapid stepping settles far quicker and no longer flickers back mid-write. @light-sntchr
- Change: **More reliable auto-calibration** — per-channel ETTR calibration now copes with dense film bases where one channel is much brighter than another: it tolerates a negligible base clip, pulls the LED down until the base truly stops clipping, and settles on the best shutter instead of oscillating. @light-sntchr
- Change: **Smaller TIFF exports** — TIFFs now use ZIP (Deflate) compression with a horizontal predictor instead of LZW, typically 15–25% smaller for 16-bit images with no change to the pixels. @RP2
- Fix: **camera reconnects cleanly after scanning** — closing the Live View or new-preset calibration window now releases the tethered camera session, so bodies (Fuji especially) that stick in tethered-capture mode no longer hang on the next connection. @bbatha
- Fix: **export no longer crashes on non-ASCII metadata** — accented or non-Latin characters in a source file's EXIF (e.g. Image Description) previously aborted a TIFF export; they're now safely substituted. @RP2
- Fix: a B&W print toned only with gold or split tints rendered grey in preview and export.
- Fix: presets no longer embed the source frame's heal strokes, and Apply settings no longer overwrites other frames' heals.
- Fix: **numpad keys bind separately** — the shortcut editor no longer collapses `Num+9` onto plain `9`, so numpad and number-row keys can hold different shortcuts. @jboneng
- Fix: **no more 'surround' warning on load** — edits saved before the old surround control was removed no longer log an unknown-key warning every time you open a file. @linkmodo
- Fix: **edits survive EXIF changes** — editing a file's EXIF metadata (e.g. tags) changes its content hash, which previously orphaned its saved edits; NegPy now falls back to matching by file path and re-homes the edits under the new hash. @RP2
- Fix: **B&W renders match between CPU and GPU** — black-and-white previews and exports no longer come out darker or subtly tinted on the CPU path, and the Analysis histogram is smooth instead of combed.
- Fix: **batch export honours the current destination** — exporting saved or selected frames now writes them to the destination you've set for the session (e.g. same-as-source) instead of the stale path each frame was last saved with. @RP2

## 0.36.0

- New: **Camera Scanning** — a new tab captures negatives with a tethered camera and feeds the RGB Scan merge. Two auto-selected modes: **Narrowband RGB** (jackw01's open-source Scanlight flashes red, then green, then blue while the camera captures each exposure) and **normal** (a single exposure under any light, imported as an ordinary RAW). Includes per-channel ETTR auto-calibration metered on the clear film base, film-stock presets, and a live view with the camera's hardware focus magnifier and live ISO/shutter controls. Cameras are detected on the USB bus automatically — no address, login or pairing. macOS and Linux only (verified on Sony bodies, other brands need testing). @light-sntchr
- New: **Split grade** — **Shadows Grade / Highlights Grade** sliders on the Tone page trim each zone's contrast in ISO-R points, like a split-grade darkroom exposure: harder shadows without blowing the highlights, or softer highlights without flattening the shadows. Mid-sparing and bounded by the paper's black and white, like the zone density sliders, and scoped per color layer through the Global/R/G/B selector like the main Grade.
- New: **Per-layer trims (crossover correction)** — a **Global / Red / Green / Blue** selector on the Tone and Process pages scopes the curve controls (Grade, Toe, Shoulder, Widths, Snap) and the White/Black Point sliders to a single color layer. Filtration can only *shift* a layer; these trims re-shape it, fixing casts that differ between shadows, mids and highlights. The H&D chart tracks the per-layer curves live.
- New: **Deeper control over the print curve**, grouped under a **Paper Response** header on the Tone page: **Snap** adjusts the paper's midtone punch, **Shadows / Highlights Density** darken or brighten each zone while rolling into the paper's black and white limits instead of clipping, and **True Black** (off by default) anchors the deepest print black to true display black instead of ~5% grey. The **Toe** slider is recalibrated so its full throw is felt as clearly as the Shoulder's — frames without a manual toe render identically.
- New: **Gold toner** — a third chemical toner on the Toning page (B&W only). Alone it works like the archival gold bath: a cool blue-black shift in the highlights and mids with a slight density boost, dense shadows hold. Over sepia it recreates the classic gold-over-sepia combination, pushing the toned highlights from yellow-brown toward orange-red.
- New: **Crop composition guides** — the crop tool's fixed thirds grid becomes a **Guide** dropdown: Thirds, Phi Grid, Diagonals, Golden Triangles, Golden Spiral, Armature, Diagonal Method or Grid. `O` cycles guides, `Shift+O` rotates the spiral/triangles.
- New: **Crop rotation handles** — four handles at the edges of the crop box spin the frame freehand, composing with the Fine Rotation slider for fine-tuning; both now range ±45°. @linkmodo
- New: **Reverse scroll-to-zoom** — an optional toggle in Customize Shortcuts for users who expect scroll-up to zoom out. @linkmodo
- Change: **Auto Cast is built in** — the toggle is gone: Cast Removal always adapts its strength to how confidently the frame's neutral greys read, and the slider (default 0.5) trims on top; 0 = off. Frames that had Auto Cast off will shift slightly.
- Change: **One visual language across the app** — all panels share the same section cards, button styles and sizes; every active tool and toggle uses the same red armed state; edited sliders, selectors and tabs are marked with a small red dot instead of colored text; tooltips word-wrap; the Metadata page uses collapsible sections like the rest; the Analysis stats read-out shows plain values without the qualitative labels.
- Change: **UI polish pass** — tooltip shortcut chips render as bordered keycaps; hovered items in menus, dropdowns and combo boxes highlight clearly; active/checked tools (Linear RAW, Lock Bounds) now read as engaged; Undo/Redo move to the toolbar (Save Edits into the More Actions menu); the crop tool shows contextual hover cursors (rotate / resize / move / draw); and confirmation dialogs default to the affirmative button on Enter. @linkmodo
- Change: **Confirm before unloading** — Unload / Unload Selected / Clear All now prompt first, and the Delete key unloads the selected frame(s). @linkmodo
- Removed: **Flare** and **Contrast Lift** — Snap and the zone density sliders cover the same ground with real control. Old edits load cleanly and render without them.
- Fix: **flip under Fine Rotation now mirrors correctly** — flipping a straightened frame produced a doubled tilt instead of a true mirror of the current render. @linkmodo
- Fix: **manual crop and freehand analysis region rotate with 90/180 turns** — they stayed put before, so a quarter-turn left the crop framing the wrong area. @linkmodo
- Fix: **viewer clears when the session empties** — Clear All or Unloading the last frame left the previous image on screen with no way to dismiss it. @linkmodo
- Fix: **startup no longer crashes when the Documents folder is missing (windows)** — a OneDrive-backed Documents path that doesn't exist on disk (OneDrive unlinked or signed out) now falls back to `~/Documents` and then the home directory instead of failing to launch. @linkmodo
- Fix: **Apply Settings counts only the frames you can see** — with a filename filter active, "Whole roll" counted (and would apply to) every loaded file instead of just the visible ones. It now matches the filtered list.

## 0.35.0

- New: **Gear Library** — a searchable library of cameras, lenses and film stocks; picking gear for a frame writes scan-rig and film metadata into the exported XMP. There are some bundled items but library is easily user-extendable. @jboneng
- New: **Freehand analysis region** — draw the exposure-metering area directly on the canvas instead of relying on the centered Analysis Buffer inset; a draw/clear pair sits on the Process page. @linkmodo
- Change: **Manual healing now clones real texture** — heals copy a matching patch from elsewhere in the frame and blend the seam, keeping grain intact instead of a smoothed synthetic fill; existing heal spots convert automatically.
- New: **Scratch Tool** — heal hairs and scratches by clicking a polyline along the defect (double-click or Enter to commit), instead of forcing them through the round brush.
- New: Enter now also commits an in-progress Dodge & Burn stroke, same as double-click.
- Change: **Canvas redesign** — the status bar and info rows around the preview are gone; the image fills the whole central area. File info moved to overlay pills in the canvas corners, the toolbar floats over the image, status messages show as a short toast.
- Change: **Export now warns before overwriting files** — a batch that would clobber existing files stops for an Overwrite / Rename / Cancel prompt instead of silently overwriting; tick "Always overwrite without asking" to bring back the old silent behavior. @linkmodo
- Change: **Bundled gear and crosstalk profiles now load live from the app** instead of being copied into your docs folder. Docs folder is reserved for your personal profiles & gear  
- Change: **Selecting a thumbnail now opens it** — a single click loads the frame into the viewer (Ctrl/Shift-click still builds a multi-selection for batch actions); double-clicking inside an open crop box now confirms and closes the tool. @linkmodo
- Change: **Cyan** now has an assignable keyboard shortcut alongside the other white-balance sliders, unbound by default (you should not be touching cyan!) — set it in the shortcut editor.
- Change: **Export UX pass** — one red **Export** button replaces the toolbar Export, "Export All" and the "Sync export settings" toggle; its chevron menu *selects* what the button does (current frame, selected, all visible) and remembers the choice, with **Export Presets** working the same way. Default sizing is now **Original** resolution, multi-frame exports ask for confirmation, and failed frames are reported instead of a false "complete".
- Fix: **crop no longer inflates under Fine Rotation** — the manual crop rectangle is now measured in the same already-rotated view you draw it on, instead of being mapped through the tilt and re-bounded, which grew the cropped area as the tilt increased. @linkmodo
- Fix: **locked/disabled controls now are greyed-out** — sliders, buttons and fields under an active lock (e.g. Analysis Buffer under Roll Average, Flat-Field k1 with no reference profile) now show a grey disabled state instead of looking identical to normal ones.
- Fix: **Next/Prev buttons now follow the sorted/filtered order** shown in the filmstrip instead of raw load order — fixes them greying out mid-roll or staying stuck (but unresponsive) at the end of a roll not loaded alphabetically.
- Fix: **large (tiled) exports no longer drift from the preview** when Separation is on or a freehand analysis region is drawn — the tiled export path was metering exposure off the raw image instead of the same unmixed, region-restricted one the preview uses.
- New: **Protect original metadata** toggle in the Metadata tab — exports keep the source file's EXIF/XMP untouched instead of NegPy rewriting it. @jboneng
- Perf: **CPU rendering is now multithreaded**, ~3.5x faster on a full-res render. @linkmodo
- Fix: HQ preview toggle no longer shows a stale render; zoom % now reflects true pixel zoom (with Fit/1:1 buttons); tooltip shortcut chips and the Crosstalk tooltip no longer overflow; Batch Analysis warning now leads with the crop count. @linkmodo

## 0.34.0

- Change: **Dodge & Burn moved into the print exposure** — masks now adjust exposure before the paper curve instead of scaling the finished image, which is how dodging and burning physically work. Strong burns and dodges roll off through the paper's toe and shoulder instead of clipping flat. The section moved to the Exposure tab; existing dodge/burn edits will render slightly differently.
- Change: **Selenium and Sepia work on print density** — both toners now convert silver density instead of tinting by brightness, matching the real baths. Selenium acts on the densest areas (deeper blacks, cooler shadows); sepia acts on the thinnest (warmer highlights, shadows hold). Existing toned edits will render differently.
- Change: **Export Presets** main button now runs only the selected frames (previews the single frame when just one is selected) instead of always exporting everything. @jboneng
- New: **Export Presets** gains an export-all-visible option, with a confirmation dialog before it runs. @jboneng
- Fix: **dodge/burn mask overlay now shows the real feathered falloff** instead of a hard-edged polygon — the on-canvas mask previously didn't match the soft edge the pipeline actually renders.
- Fix: **exporting all RGB-scan triplets no longer fails** with "Input/output error" on most frames. Batch export was reusing stale saved paths for each frame's green/blue exposures instead of the ones the triplet was actually built from, so it tried to read files that weren't there; it now uses each frame's own exposures, the same as exporting one at a time.
- Fix: exported **JPEG EXIF** no longer blocks ExifTool from rewriting tags — stale RAW preview SubIFD pointers are now stripped on export. @jboneng


## 0.33.0

- New: **Temperature slider** — a Kelvin lever above the CMY white balance: drag it and Magenta/Yellow move together along the warm–cool axis in the right ratio, like re-dialing a dichroic filter pack, while your green–magenta tint stays put. Move M/Y (or Pick WB) yourself and the slider reads back the print's temperature instead. Warm sits on the right, travel is mired-linear (equal drag = equal perceived shift), and `T`/`G` nudge it from the keyboard. The thermometer button locks the temperature for the roll: every frame you open gets re-aimed to it — keeping its own tint — and the lock survives restarts.
- Change: **White balance sliders are real CC filtration** — ±1.0 = ±20cc of density on any frame. Before, the same slider position did more on a contrasty negative and less on a flat one, so a WB that worked on one frame drifted on the next. Frames with saved WB will shift slightly.
- Change: **Paper base tint sits in the paper white** — Fujicolor Crystal Archive's cool tint now lives in the base density, so it shows in the highlights and disappears into the blacks, like actual paper. Turning off Paper White turns the tint off with it.
- New: **RA-4 dye coupling** — Kodak Endura and Fujicolor Crystal Archive model the unwanted absorptions of their print dyes. Greys stay neutral; strong colors shift the way they do on real paper. Values estimated based on manufacturers technical sheets.
- New: **Histogram pixel marker** — hover the image and the Analysis histogram marks the pixel's R, G and B values with dashed lines in channel colors.
- New: **Tone-curve drag feedback** — while dragging a Tone slider, the H&D chart keeps the pre-drag curve as a faded ghost so you see exactly what moved; Toe/Shoulder sliders glow their zone of the curve, Grade/Density highlight the pivot crosshair.
- Change: **Lock Bounds** is now a labeled button beside Linear RAW in the Process panel, instead of a small icon squeezed next to the process dropdown that many likely missed.
- New: **Expanded tutorial** — the walkthrough now explains the physics behind the pipeline (log density, the H&D print, orange-mask metering) and why a tight crop or the Analysis Buffer matters for clean black/white points. New steps for the Analysis Buffer, Crosstalk dye unmixing, roll consistency, Cast Removal and the Finish panel.
- Fix: the **GPU histogram** was binning scene-linear values since the scene-linear pipeline rework (0.30.0), reading darker than the CPU one — both now bin the display-encoded image.
- Fix: the bundled **RGBScan input ICC profile** used an sRGB TRC instead of the gamma 2.2 curve NegPy's pipeline expects at that stage, lifting the toe and giving a washed-out look — rebuilt to match, same color transform. @thetalkingdrum
- Fix: a **roll's Batch Analysis baseline no longer leaks onto other rolls** — the roll-wide bounds and color balance were being remembered globally and quietly applied to every freshly opened file, so a different film stock (e.g. mask-less Phoenix II) came up with a heavy cast until you hit Reset. The baseline now stays with the roll it was measured on; open a new roll and it meters per frame again.

## 0.32.1

- Perf: fewer disk syncs on every edit (settings writes batched into one transaction), smoother slider dragging, faster contact-sheet/batch/tiled export, and lighter preview rendering — no change in output.

## 0.32.0

- Change: **Crosstalk moved to the Process panel** — the unmix now applies to the raw negative densities **before** analysis and inversion, making it more physically correct. Old edits migrate automatically, but expect a subtle shift on frames that used Separation. Re-run Batch Analysis after changing it.
- Change: **Process panel split** into *Process* and *Roll Analysis* collapsibles.
- New: **Print stats row** — exposure in stops and CMY white balance as dichroic CC filtration (±1.0 = ±20cc).
- New: **Scan clip warning** — per-channel share of source pixels at sensor white (red above 1%); in a negative scan that clipping destroys base/shadow separation and can only be fixed at capture.
- Change: **halation** is masked in linear light (its footprint no longer moves with Grade/Density) and, like glow, composited additively.
- Fix: the **H&D chart now matches the render at hard grades** — the grade-coupled toe/shoulder was applied by the engine but not shown by the chart.

## 0.31.2

- Fix: in the **Apply** dialog, ticking **Tonal span** or **Color balance** no longer clears the other — each now toggles only its own axis (Use Luma Average / Use Color Average) on the target frames and leaves the other as it was. (#375)
- Fix: the **filmstrip thumbnail** now tracks the current edit — resetting settings or adjusting sliders updates the grid preview in place, instead of leaving it stale until you switch, save or export. (#376)

## 0.31.1

- Fix: new bundled Lab Crosstalk matrices weren't copied to the user's profile folder on startup once any profile already existed there — each bundled matrix is now seeded independently, so later releases' additions show up without waiting on a fresh install.

## 0.31.0

- **Default tone curve retuned** — Auto Grade targets slightly lower contrast, and the midtone contrast boost eases in more gradually, for a softer out-of-the-box look.
- **Cast Removal is now a slider** — the toggle becomes a 0–1 **strength** slider to dial color-cast neutralization back partway (default 0.5). A small **auto** button (like Density/Grade) sets the strength from how confidently the frame's neutral references read — clean greys full, few-neutral scenes gentler — with the slider trimming on top.
- **Lens distortion correction** — the Flat-Field profile gains a **k1** slider for radial (barrel/pincushion) correction, alongside illumination correction. Folded into the geometry transform (no RAW re-decode on drag), scale-to-fill, and kept in sync with crop/retouch/dodge-burn.
- **Apply settings dialog** — the Sync Edits / Sync Crop buttons become one **Apply** button opening a dialog: pick Selected frames or the whole roll, tick any of Process, Crop, Rotation, Exposure, Color, Finish, Tonal span and Color balance. The bounds options broadcast the source frame's normalization as a locked roll baseline (single-frame Batch Normalization).
- **Optional edit sidecars** — mirror edits to plain `.negpy` files next to the source for archival (SQLite stays primary). Off by default; enable in the Export panel or write on demand. Loading falls back to a beside-source sidecar when there's no DB entry, and promotes it into the DB.
- **Exposure panel split into Color + Tone** — two independent collapsible sections, each with its own edited badge and reset: **Color** (white balance, Cast Removal) and **Tone** (density, grade, toe/shoulder, contrast lift, paper). The region selector is now an icon column beside the CMY sliders (yellow when adjusted), the heading names the active region, and Pick WB is an eyedropper. Color shows an RGB mini-histogram, Tone the luminance one.
- **Geometry gets its own tab** — the Setup tab (Presets, Geometry, Process) is split: Geometry and Flat Field move to a dedicated tab, leaving Setup as Presets + Process.
- **Kodak Aerocolor IV 2460 crosstalk matrix** added to the bundled Lab Crosstalk profiles (also sold as SantaColor 100 / 1Hundred). @whepper
- **Flat master as a per-preset export option** — export presets gain a **render intent** (Print or Flat master), so **Export Presets** can produce a mix in one click — e.g. JPEG + PNG + Flat Master — independently of the main panel's Print/Flat toggle. Manage Presets' **+** button now offers a Print or a Flat master preset (flat presets limit format to 16-bit TIFF / Linear DNG). @jboneng
- Fix: toggling **Linear RAW** no longer leaves a stale magenta cast — the auto-meter cache invalidates when the RAW decode changes.
- Fix: the **Flatfield Correction** toggle is no longer reset to off when switching files or applying edits — it was colliding with RGB Scan's toggle in saved settings.
- Fix: sidebar labels no longer show an opaque black background patch against lighter section panels, and field labels next to combos/entries now share consistent styling across panels.
- Fix: right-panel sections now stack from the top at their natural height instead of stretching to fill the panel and splitting the leftover space between them.
- Fix: the tutorial overlay's body text no longer pans slightly wider than its popup — long unbreakable strings (e.g. file paths) now wrap instead of pushing the content past the visible width. @seanharding

## 0.30.2

- **Cast Removal — cleaner highlights** — the per-channel gray balance now anchors a third (highlight) reference, fitting a curve through highlight/midtone/shadow instead of a line. Fixes highlights occasionally overcorrecting past neutral (toward magenta) under 0.30.1.
- **More bundled crosstalk profiles** — additional Lab Crosstalk matrices for common film stocks, derived from official datasheets. @jboneng

## 0.30.1

- **Improved Cast Removal** — neutral greys no longer drift slightly green. Cast Removal now balances each color layer at the **midtone** as well as the shadows (a true two-point per-channel gray balance), measured only on near-neutral pixels so green-heavy scenes (foliage, skin) can't pull the balance. Previously the midtone leaned on a single luminance reading that is mostly green, leaving a faint green cast on many C-41 conversions. The default look shifts slightly toward neutral.

## 0.30.0

- **Scene-linear pipeline** — the whole conversion now runs in scene-linear light internally: the creative stages (Retouch, Lab, Local, Toning, Finishing) operate on linear light instead of gamma-encoded data, so their math is physically correct, and the "print" color space is now the wide-gamut **ProPhoto RGB**. The output/display transform is applied **only at the very end** with the correct working-space curve, fixing a latent mismatch where the internal buffer was sRGB-encoded but tagged as a wider space. Dust retouching keeps the same (perceptual) detection but now heals in linear light, with the CPU and GPU paths unified. In practice: more headroom before saturated colors clip, and a more accurate, slightly more saturated default look — existing edits will look a touch different, so re-tune Saturation/Toning to taste.
- **Independent roll average for luma and color** — the single **Use Roll Average** toggle is now two buttons, **Use Luma Average** and **Use Color Average**. You can take the roll-wide tonal-range (black/white-point) baseline while letting each frame find its own color balance, or vice-versa. With both on it behaves exactly like the old Use Roll Average; with both off, like per-image local.
-  **Linear RAW on by default** — RAW files now decode with neutral (1,1,1,1) multipliers, bypassing the camera's as-shot white balance. You can still re-enable camera WB with the **Linear RAW** toggle in the Exposure sidebar (off = camera WB applied).
- **Faster auto-exposure analysis** — the block-median prefilter behind Auto Density/Grade and normalization is now multi-threaded with bit-for-bit identical results, roughly 2.5× faster on large frames, so opening files and batch analysis feel snappier.
- **Snappier live preview (GPU)** — the GPU preview no longer re-meters the negative every frame (auto-exposure analysis is cached per image and reused while you drag creative sliders), and the engine caches bind groups, uses lighter preview decodes and a source cache. Dragging sliders is dramatically smoother and repeat exports are faster, with identical results.
- **Contact-sheet output location & templates** — set an explicit output folder for the contact sheet, and save/recall named layout templates. @jboneng
- **Flat output tidies the Export panel** — the Flat intent hides controls that don't apply, and honours your Print/Pixels sizing. @jboneng
- **Export panel reorganised** — laid out in export order (output intent, settings, then the Export buttons), with presets, contact sheet and preview tucked into collapsible sections below.
- **Rule-of-thirds grid on crop**, plus a denser 10×10 leveling grid while fine-rotating.
- **Edited controls turn yellow** — changed sliders and the tabs holding them tint yellow, so you can see what you've touched.
- **VISION3 500T crosstalk matrix** added to the bundled Lab Crosstalk profiles.
- Fix: main window now fits small (1368×768) screens, and remembers its size/position.
- Fix: long monitor ICC profile names no longer force a horizontal scrollbar in the Export panel.
- Fix: Pakon `.raw` files no longer show a thin strip of garbage pixels along the left edge (and process a touch darker) — the loader now skips the file's small header.

## 0.29.1

- Fix: Previously RGB Scan mode only merged exposures if it was enabled BEFORE loading the files. Now toggling the mode after files are loaded forces the process. (#319)
- Fix: Flat export having heavy colorcasts for some files. It also follows the selected colorspace instead of hardcoding ProPhoto (#321)
- Fix: New crosstalk matrices not being correctly bundled with build in 0.29.0.

## 0.29.0

- **RGB Scan (new)** — for negatives shot as three separate frames under red, green and blue light, combine them into one clean, low-noise color scan. Turn on the **RGB Scan** button in the Files sidebar; folders of shots are grouped into triplets automatically, and an **Edit RGB Triplet…** menu lets you fix the grouping. The frames are aligned to each other to avoid color fringing, then run through the normal conversion as usual.
- **Asymmetric H&D print curve** — reworked exposure/normalization around a film-style characteristic curve with independent toe and shoulder, plus an absolute-percentile color clip and a luma-decoupled.
- **Darkroom paper profiles (reintroduced)** — a paper dropdown in the Exposure panel applies per-paper curve shaping rather than post-processing (tonal, per-channel gamma, base tint) mapped from Ilford/Kodak/Foma/Fuji datasheets. Gated by process mode and sticky roll-wide.
- **JPEG XL (.jxl) export (new)** — support in python libs is somewhat restricted yet so the UI restricts it to representable spaces (sRGB, Display P3, Rec 2020, Greyscale) and doesn't support embedding custom .icc.
- **WebP (.webp) export (new)** — 8-bit lossy or lossless, with a **Lossless** toggle plus Quality and Method (encoder effort) sliders. Works with any export color space (ICC embedded). The quality/effort knobs in JPEG and JPEG XL are now sliders too.
- **Flat master output (new)** — a new "Flat — for editing elsewhere" output intent that exports a **true log master** (S-Log/LogC-style): a flat, low-contrast, milky digital intermediate for grading in Lightroom/Darktable/Photoshop/Resolve. Instead of the print curve it emits the normalized log signal directly as the code value (no `10^-D` decode, no display gamma — that decode is what makes a normal positive), `code = clip(lift + gain·(1 − val))`, so the master holds maximal latitude and is fully invertible. Exported as a wide-gamut **16-bit TIFF** (or optional **Linear DNG**); skips the creative print look (auto density/grade, cast removal, lab, toning, finish) and maps camera RAWs to ProPhoto-linear via the camera's own matrix. New **Output Intent** section in Export with a Print/Flat toggle, **Preview Flat** peek and a **Roll Baseline** button for roll-wide consistency. Standard "Print" mode is unaffected. @jboneng
- **More film scanners supported** — dedicated film scanners on the SANE *pieusb* backend (Reflecta, Pacific Image) now work instead of being skipped, including their infrared dust-removal channel, plus several fixes to scanner mode and option handling. @hullrich
- **Histogram linear/log toggle** — a **LIN / LOG** pill in the histogram switches the count axis, lifting sparse shadow/highlight detail. Instant repaint, persisted across restarts. @jboneng
- **Unified crop tool** — the separate Manual-draw and Move Crop tools are merged into one **Crop** tool: drag corners to resize, drag inside to move, click outside to draw a fresh rect. While the tool is open it previews the full uncropped frame instead of the already-cropped image. Corner handles now track the cursor exactly (no snapping), aspect-ratio locking and min-size are computed in screen-pixel space (correct on non-square sources), and the overlay draws the actual axis-aligned crop box under fine rotation instead of a tilted quad. Dragging the rect no longer forces a full CPU recompute of exposure/retouch/lab/local on every step. On top of this. Auto-exposure bounds recompute is deferred until the crop tool closes (no per-drag re-normalization lag), enabling Auto crop exits the Manual crop tool, and a new **Reset** button beside Crop clears the manual crop and disables auto crop. @reederphill
- **Custom crosstalk profiles** — bundled Kodak Gold 200, Portra 400 and VISION3 250D matrices for the Lab Crosstalk control, plus bundled a Claude skill to derive a `.toml` matrix from a film datasheet.
- **History panel (new)** — a **History** tab in the right panel lists every edit step for the current photo. Click any step to jump back to that intermediate state (the preview updates instantly), carry on editing from there, or right-click to **Export this version**. Surfaces the existing per-file undo history (last 100 steps) as a scrollable list.
- **Expanded interactive tutorial** — the first-run walkthrough now covers the newer features too: RGB Scan, Flat-Field correction, the crop/straighten tools, paper profiles, toning, Dodge & Burn, the History panel and the Flat master export, alongside refreshed Exposure (ISO-R grade, H&D curve) and Process (Luma/Color clip) steps.
- File pickers now reopen at your last folder instead of the system root.
- Fix: **thumbnails now update when you switch away** — editing a photo and moving to the next one refreshes the edited frame's thumbnail in the grid, instead of leaving it stale until you re-open or explicitly save it.
- Fix: **X-Trans full-res demosaic** uses DHT instead of VNG, removing dot/maze artifacts on Fujifilm sensors. @reederphill

## 0.28.0

- **Dodge & Burn (new)** — local lighten/darken with freehand **polygon masks**, darkroom-style. Click to drop vertices, double-click (or snap-to-start) to close, and click inside a mask to reselect it; each mask carries its own EV strength and feather radius. Masks are stored in raw-image space and re-projected through the geometry transform, so they survive rotation, flip and crop. The stage runs on the **GPU with bit-for-bit CPU parity**, with a **Show Masks** toggle in the new Local sidebar section. (#274, #275) @reederphill
- **Session restore** — NegPy now remembers the files you had open and offers to reopen them on the next launch. Moved or deleted files drop out automatically and your per-file edits come back. (#276)
- **Rule-of-thirds grid while straightening** — a 3×3 alignment grid appears on the canvas while you drag the Fine Rotation slider, giving horizontal/vertical references to level horizons and buildings; it fades shortly after you release. (#258, #271)
- **Cross-platform monitor profile detection** — the preview's display-profile auto-detection now works beyond Windows: **colord** on Linux (Wayland + X11), **ColorSync** on macOS, and PIL on Windows. macOS falls back to **Display P3** (not sRGB) when the OS reports no profile, matching modern Mac panels. When no profile can be detected (e.g. wlroots compositors like Hyprland/Sway, which don't register a display with colord), the **Display** selector in Export turns red, prompting you to pick your monitor's color space manually. (#277)
- Fix: **all export presets are visible again** — the Presets list no longer clips its last entry on short screens; the nested scroll area that collapsed and swallowed wheel scrolling has been removed. (#270, #273)

## 0.27.1

- Fix: the default export color space is now sRGB instead of Adobe RGB, so exports get a real ICC transform rather than just a wide-gamut tag that many viewers misread as sRGB. **Soft proof** now defaults on so the preview reflects the export color-space clamp instead of silently diverging from it, and the toggle is surfaced more clearly. Monitor ICC detection failures now log a warning instead of a silent debug message. @reederphil
- Fix: **crop UX** activating Manual Crop now resets to the full image instead of keeping a stale rect or autocrop from a prior session. The Manual and Auto buttons show a red corner-dot indicator when a crop is active, so it's visible without inspecting the button state. @reederphil

## 0.27.0

- **Flat-field correction** (new, off by default) — corrects illumination falloff/vignetting from your light source or scanner using a reference scan of the bare light. New **Flat Field** section in the Setup tab: save named reference profiles, pick the active one, and toggle correction per image.
- **Contact-sheet export** — render all visible frames into a single darkroom-style contact sheet. New **Contact Sheet** section in the Export panel with cell size, gap, margin and max-tiles controls.
- **Batch progress popup** — batch analysis, batch export and thumbnail generation now show a floating popup with an animated spinner, current file and progress, alongside the existing status-bar indicator. Batch export and batch analysis can be **aborted** from the popup; aborting export keeps the files already written and skips the rest.
- **Thumbnail right-click menu** — right-click a frame in the filmstrip for quick access to Export, Copy / Paste / Reset Settings and Unload, without leaving the contact sheet. Right-clicking an unselected frame selects it first; with multiple frames selected the menu acts on the whole selection and adds **Export Selected** and **Sync Edits to Selection**.
- **Export presets** — save named export configurations (format, sizing, output destination, color space) and run them in one click. A new **Manage** dialog lets you add, duplicate, reorder and delete presets; each preset has an enable toggle. Presets are stored globally and pinned to the top of the Export panel in a collapsible section. The **Export Presets** button exports the current file through every enabled preset at once, while the normal Export / Export All buttons keep exporting with the settings shown in the panel. New installs ship with **JPEG** (enabled), **TIFF** and **PNG** (disabled) starter presets. @reederphill
- Fix: **Sync Edits** no longer overwrites the target's crop, rotation and flips — it now carries over only the manual-crop rectangle and fine rotation, leaving the target's geometry otherwise untouched. @reederphill
- Fix: the **Unload** button now clears just the selected files when more than one is selected (falling back to clearing all), with a tooltip that reflects the action. @reederphill
- Fix: next/previous navigation now follows the displayed (sorted/filtered) order. @reederphill
- Fix: **trackpad scrolling** in the filmstrip now uses pixel-precise deltas with native momentum instead of feeling much faster than the rest of the OS. @reederphill

## 0.26.0

**Reworked interface** — the panels have been reorganised around the editing workflow.

- **Editing tools split into workflow tabs** — the single long Controls list is now four icon tabs that follow the pipeline: **Setup** (Presets, Geometry, Process), **Exposure**, **Color** (Lab, Toning) and **Finish** (Retouch, Finishing), alongside **Export**, **Metadata** and **Scan**. The tab bar is icon-only with hover tooltips, and each tab scrolls on its own. Jump straight to a tab with `Ctrl+1`–`Ctrl+7` (rebindable, shown in the `?` overlay).
- **Analysis pinned to the top** — the histogram, photometric curve and stats now sit in a sticky, collapsible **Analysis** section at the top of the right panel (instead of a left-panel tab), and a draggable divider lets you resize Analysis vs. the controls below it. Its size and open/closed state persist across restarts.
- **Left panel is now just the filmstrip** — Export, Metadata, Scan and Analysis moved to the right panel, leaving the left side a clean contact sheet.
- **Contact-sheet thumbnails** — the filmstrip is now a justified grid: thumbnails scale to fill the panel width and add/remove a column as you resize, with a subtle border hugging each image (no boxy cell). The current image is shown full-brightness with a gold frame while the rest are dimmed. Labels are dropped for a denser sheet (filename still on hover).
- **Compact filmstrip toolbar** — file actions (Add files / folder, Clear, Hot Folder, Sync Edits, Sync Crop) are now a single row of icon buttons, with Sort folded into a dropdown.
- **GPU acceleration moved to the bottom toolbar** — a single ⚡ toggle (with a tooltip showing on/off and the active backend) replaces the checkbox + badge in the side panel.
- **`Esc` cancels the active tool** — deselect WB Pick / Manual Crop / Move Crop / Heal without clicking its button again.
- **`Shift+A` triggers Autocrop** — new keyboard shortcut for the Auto crop button.
- **UI scaling** — a **UI Scale** entry in the toolbar ⋯ menu scales the whole interface from 80% to 120% (applied on next launch).
- Fix: a freshly selected thumbnail could briefly show a wrong (blue) color cast until you re-selected the file — rendered thumbnails are now color-managed to match the canvas and captured only once the render has settled.
- Fix: **preview is now color-managed to your monitor** — the preview previously assumed an sRGB display, so on a wide-gamut screen (e.g. Display P3) it looked over-saturated or washed out and shifted when you changed the Output ICC. The final preview is now converted to the monitor's ICC profile, auto-detected from the screen the window is on (and re-detected when you move it to another display). Falls back to sRGB when the OS reports no profile. (#243)
- **Display profile selector** (Export → ICC): a new **Display** dropdown shows the auto-detected monitor profile ("As detected — …") and lets you override it with a common space (sRGB, Display P3, Adobe RGB, Rec 2020, ProPhoto). Use the override on wide-gamut monitors whose profile the OS doesn't report (common on Linux). Affects the preview only, not the export.
- **Soft proof toggle** (Export → ICC, off by default): like Photoshop's *Proof Colors*. Off, the preview is simply your edit shown correctly on your monitor and the Output/Input ICC affect the exported file only. On, the preview simulates the Output profile. Defaulting off keeps the preview stable when you change export color space.
- **Paper/printer soft proofing**: with Soft proof on, selecting a paper/printer ICC (RGB or CMYK) as Output now simulates the print on screen — paper white, reduced black, and gamut compression (absolute-colorimetric proofing). Previously paper profiles changed nothing in the preview (and CMYK profiles silently did nothing).

## 0.25.0

- **Reworked negative conversion** — the default conversion now behaves much more like a real darkroom print: paper-like highlight roll-off, true deep blacks, and a paper-white base. Out-of-the-box results should look more natural and respond more predictably as you adjust Density and Grade.
- **Auto Density** (new, on by default) — meters each frame individually and sets a sensible brightness, so an over- or under-exposed negative comes out usable without manual tweaking. It corrects *partially*, so a deliberately dark (low-key) or bright (high-key) shot keeps its mood instead of being flattened to a neutral grey.
- **Auto Grade** (new, on by default) — chooses contrast to suit each scene, gently: a flat scene gets a little lift, a punchy scene stays punchy, but nothing is pushed to a harsh extreme. Together with Auto Density this aims for results that look right straight away while staying easy to fine-tune.
- **Grade now uses the ISO R scale** — contrast is set on the photographic ISO R paper-grade scale (R180 very soft … R110 ≈ classic grade 2 … R50 very hard) instead of the old 0–5 number, so the curve's 10–90% span maps to a real paper exposure range. Old saved 0–5 grades migrate automatically (R = 150 − 20·G), keeping the look of existing edits.
- **With the auto helpers off, the conversion follows your negative honestly** — a dense / over-exposed negative comes out dense and contrasty, a thin / flat negative comes out flat. Nothing is normalised away, so the print reflects exactly how the frame was exposed and developed. Flip the toggles off when you want the conversion to *show you your photography* rather than smooth it out — a useful way to read your own exposure and development.
- **Cast Removal** (new, on by default) — automatically neutralizes the color cast a negative leaves in the print. It balances each color layer so greys read neutral all the way from the deep shadows through the highlights, not just in the midtones — the usual cause of shadows or highlights drifting off-color after a midtone white balance (C-41).
- **Contrast Lift** (new, off by default) — a gentle contrast lift about paper white based on preferred tone reproduction (Bartleson-Breneman): prints viewed in a normal room want slightly more midtone contrast than a 1:1 reproduction, so this darkens midtones a touch and adds snap.
- **Flare** (new, off by default) — a darkroom-style veiling-glare floor that gently lifts the deepest blacks and softens the toe for a more film-like look, while leaving paper white fixed.
- **Autocrop rework**: more robust film-edge detection, with a new **Autocrop Mode** selector in the Geometry sidebar — *Image only* crops to the exposed image area (default), *Film edge* crops to the full film extent, keeping the rebate/sprockets. Detection should be more reliable across stocks and border types.
- **Custom crosstalk matrices**: the Lab **Crosstalk** control (renamed from *Separation*) now has a profile dropdown. Drop your own `.toml` calibration matrices in the `NegPy/crosstalk` folder (a starter set is seeded on first run) and pick them per film stock or scanner; the built-in matrix stays available as *Default*. See `docs/CROSSTALK.md` for the format and how to contribute matrices to the bundled gallery.
- Fix: **ICC color management now apply correctly on export** — The on-screen preview is now color-managed through a working-space → sRGB display LUT, so what you see matches the exported file.
- **ICC moved into Export panel**: a dedicated **ICC** section holds explicit **Input** and **Output** selectors. The Output selector lists target color spaces and custom ICC profiles (bundled profiles that duplicate a color-space entry are hidden). The Output selection drives both the preview and the exported file (WYSIWYG — no separate apply toggle): the preview shows the output space directly, matching the file as seen in a non-color-managed viewer, and the export converts to and embeds the same profile. Input ICC corrects the source. The standalone ICC section in the right Controls panel has been removed.
- **Hideable side panels**: the left Session panel and right Controls panel can now be collapsed for a focused, canvas-only view. New toggle buttons sit at the outer edges of the bottom toolbar (and `Ctrl+[` / `Ctrl+]` shortcuts) — the button reflects each panel's current state and hidden/shown state is remembered across restarts.
- Fix: **color adjustments now use the correct working color space** — Saturation, Vibrance, Chroma Denoise and Split Toning compute their CIELAB without converting to sRGB, so colors — greens and cyans especially — shift more accurately and predictably. Neutral greys are unaffected.
- Fix: export no longer drops metadata when the source EXIF carries an out-of-range tag.
- Fix: **Batch Analysis** now respects the file browser filter — with a filter active, only the visible files are analyzed, matching Batch Export's behaviour (instead of always running on every file in the folder). (#237)

## 0.24.0

- Added **Before/After**: toggle button ◑ on toolbar (and `\` shortcut) to flash the un-graded auto conversion of the current frame, so you can see what your edits changed at a glance.
- **Faster preview loading**: opening and navigating between photos is now faster. Previews use a quick decode for display (full quality is still used on export), recently-viewed images are kept in memory, and an embedded thumbnail shows immediately while the full preview loads. @reederphill
- **Process** sliders: White/Black Point offsets stay editable while Roll Average is on (only Analysis Buffer and D-Range Clip are locked by roll average). Disabled sliders can no longer be scrubbed by dragging their label. @reederphill
- **Selection vs. open**: clicking a thumbnail now only selects it (for batch operations); double-click — or the arrow keys — opens it for editing. Importing files or a folder auto-opens the first one. @reederphill
- **Batch Analysis** now applies the current image's **Analysis Buffer** and **D-Range Clip** to every file in the roll before averaging — set them once on the open frame and the whole batch shares that setting (instead of each file using its own saved value). The confirmation dialog now opens every time you run it, explaining what the analysis does, how those two sliders are applied, and the crop status of the roll (so you know if any files will be analyzed on the full frame).
- Switching photos no longer blanks the canvas — the previous frame stays on screen, dimmed under a loading spinner, until the new one is ready.
- Fix: exporting a file whose source has a large embedded thumbnail or maker-note no longer silently drops all metadata — oversized EXIF is now trimmed to fit the JPEG limit instead of failing.

## 0.23.2

- Fix: a manually cropped photo no longer fails to load with "asdict() should be called on dataclass instances" after switching to another photo and returning. The crop rectangle was reloaded as a list instead of a tuple, making the config unhashable and crashing the render cache. (#228)

## 0.23.1

- Fix: adjust thresholds for film type detection to reduce negatives falsely recognized as positives.
- Made **process mode autodetect** toggleable using button next to the process dropdown.


## 0.23.0

- **D-Range Clip** now extends into negative values for outward headroom. The slider previously bottomed out at the true min/max (no clipping); pulling it below 0 pushes the normalization bounds *beyond* the histogram extremes, leaving lifted blacks and unclipped highlights for a gentler-than-default stretch. Positive values behave exactly as before (clipping the tails for more aggressive recovery).
- Added **Process mode autodetect**: new files are now analyzed on load and the process mode (C41 / B&W / E-6) is set automatically — orange-mask detection for C41, channel-correlation for B&W, balanced channels for E-6. Detection only applies to files without saved settings, so it never overrides a mode you set yourself.
- Fix: JPEG export now uses **4:4:4** chroma subsampling instead of libjpeg's default 4:2:0, preserving full color resolution at quality 95. Fine film grain and color detail no longer pick up chroma artifacts on export. (#224)

## 0.22.3

- Fix: exported images now honor the source file's EXIF orientation and match the preview — rotation and crop no longer drift on export for files carrying an orientation tag. (#218)

## 0.22.2

- Fix: tiled GPU export now correctly applies IR dust removal — it was silently skipped when the image was split into tiles during high-resolution export. (#216)
- Fix: tiled GPU export no longer applies vignette independently per tile — vignette is now computed over the full frame so seams don't appear on large exports. (#217)

## 0.22.1

- Fix: **Batch Analysis** now respects each file's crop and orientation when computing the roll-wide baseline. Previously, files with large borders (e.g. 6×6 negatives in a 3:2 scan) skewed the average because analysis ran on the full frame. (#213)
- **Sync Crop**: split the Sync Edits button in two — `Sync Edits` (exposure / lab / toning / process settings, preserves per-file crop) and `Sync Crop` (manual crop + rotation only). Useful when every frame on a roll shares the same scanner mask.
- Added **Analysis Buffer overlay**: while moving the Analysis Buffer slider, the canvas shows a dim border around the excluded region with a dashed accent-colored boundary, so you can see exactly what's being analyzed. Disappears shortly after the last slider movement.
- Pre-batch warning: if none of the selected files have a crop set, Batch Analysis prompts before running and points to either cropping or raising the Analysis Buffer.
- Status bar during Batch Analysis now indicates per-file crop state (`[cropped]` vs `[full frame]`).
- Lowered default **Analysis Buffer** to 0.05 and clamped slider max to 0.25 to match the underlying clamp in analysis.

## 0.22.0

- **Tool-aware cursor**: mouse pointer changes shape to reflect the active tool — pointing hand for WB Pick, crosshair for Manual Crop, open/closed hand for Move Crop, hidden cursor (brush circle) for Heal.
- Added **IR Dust Removal**: uses the infrared channel from IR-capable scanners (Nikon Coolscan, Epson flatbeds with SilverFast iSRD, VueScan 4-channel output) to detect and inpaint dust and scratches with near-zero false positives. Toggle and threshold slider in the Retouch panel — controls are disabled automatically when no IR channel is present in the loaded file.
- IR channel is read from: 4-channel TIFFs with ExtraSamples (VueScan, NegPy's own scanner output), multi-page TIFFs with a grayscale IR page (SilverFast iSRD), and `_IR.tif` sidecar files.
- **Tooltips**: added detailed tooltips to every sidebar control — sliders, buttons, dropdowns, and checkboxes. Controls with keyboard shortcuts show dynamic shortcut chips that update when bindings are customised.
- **Optimizations**: optimizations to preview loading speed. @reederphill

  ## 0.21.0

  - Added initial **Scanner support** on Linux and macOS: new Scan tab — select a SANE-compatible scanner, choose resolution, bit depth, output format, and filename template; scanned files auto-load into the session. This is initial implementation, tested with Plustek 8100 on Arch Linux and latest macOS. As it often is with (old in most cases of film scanners) hardware support i cannot guarantee that it will support your scanner. **IMPORTANT:** check [README.md](../README.md) for information about SANE dependencies. **IMPORTANT**
  - Added **Lock Bounds** button in the Process section — freeze normalization bounds so cropping and re-analysis don't overwrite them; useful for locking in exposure after initial analysis.
  - Added **Copy/Paste Bounds** between files — transfer normalization bounds from one file to another (**CTRL+Shift+C** -> CTRL+V).
  - **Canvas zoom**: pinch-to-zoom gesture support; smooth trackpad scrolling; increased min/max zoom bounds. @reederphill
  - Fix: TIFF export with ICC profile applied produced 8-bit tiffs.
  - Fix: Custom metadata not written correctly in tiffs.
  - Fix: Hot folder mode caused session UI debouncing lag.
  - Fix: **Saturation** slider above 1.0 darkened already-saturated reds/blues. Saturation now scales chroma in CIELAB, preserving perceived lightness (matches Vibrance behavior). (#193)
  - Docs: More detailed [USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md)


## 0.20.0

- Added **filtering** options to film strip - details in [FILTERING.md](FILTERING.md)
- Fix: HQ preview scaling up crop offset setting.

## 0.19.0

- Added **Metadata panel**: new "Metadata" tab in the session panel — set Film stock, Format, Developer, Push/Pull, and Scanner info written as EXIF tags into exported files. Shows read-only inherited EXIF from the source file (camera make/model, lens, exposure settings). Optionally sync custom metadata across all files in a batch export.
- Added **Detect Aspect Ratio** button in the Geometry sidebar (crosshairs icon) — finds the film frame in the image and sets the crop ratio to the closest standard aspect ratio.
- Added **Same folder as source** export option — exports files to their source directory instead of a fixed export path.
- Added **Overwrite existing files** toggle — when disabled, exports get incrementing suffixes (`_2`, `_3`) to avoid overwriting.
- **Sticky flip**: Flip Horizontal/Vertical buttons now show a pressed state when active and their state persists across files and app restarts (applied to new files only — files with saved edits keep their own flip).
- Tutorial overlay now shows keyboard navigation hints at the bottom.
- Fix: mouse input in tutorial (Windows) @alessandrv
- Fix: exports are now written atomically — no partial files left on crash or interrupt.
- Fix: Rotate CCW/CW buttons (and `[` / `]` shortcuts) reversed direction when the image was flipped horizontally or vertically (but not both).
- Performance & stability improvements.

## 0.18.2

- Fix: GPU export crop now recomputed at full resolution instead of scaling up the preview ROI — fixes misaligned crop on export when using crop offset with autocrop or manual crop.
- Fix: applying autocrop no longer silently resets the crop ratio to "Free" — the user's chosen ratio is preserved.

## 0.18.1

- Fix: startup crash on Windows systems with non-UTF-8 locale (e.g. Traditional Chinese cp950) caused by reading the stylesheet and other files without explicit encoding.
- Fix: tutorial popup body text cut off on long steps (e.g. Lab panel) — body now scrolls when content exceeds available height.

## 0.18.0

- Added **Interactive Tutorial**: step-by-step overlay walkable from the toolbar, covering the full pipeline from loading files to export.
- Added **Move Crop** tool: translate an existing manual crop rectangle without resizing it — new button in the Geometry sidebar (disabled until a crop rect is set).
- Added **Target Pixel Size** export mode: alongside the existing Print DPI and Original Resolution options, you can now export to a specific long-edge pixel count. Old `use_original_res` workspace files are automatically migrated to the new `export_resolution_mode` field.
- Improved **Autocrop**: more robust edge detection; autocrop is now off by default and resets when the button is deselected. @alessandrv
- Fix: HQ preview no longer inflates bounds analysis — analysis is always run on the downsampled image, eliminating noise from single dead pixels or sharp dust spots that could throw off normalization. (#162)

## 0.17.2

- Fix: batch normalization and batch export progress bars now properly updates on status bar.
- Fix: export filename templating now preserves `original_name` verbatim — dashes, spaces, and multiple/leading/trailing underscores in the original filename are no longer mangled by the cleanup pass.
- Changed default export filename pattern from `positive_{{ original_name }}` to `{{ original_name }}`.
- Changed default export colorspace to be `Same as source` (detected from input file).
- UX: Status bar - replaced zoom % and resolution (shown elsewhere) with a file position counter (`3 / 12`) for batch workflows.

## 0.17.1

- Fix: new vignette shaders not being bundled with appimage on linux
- Fix: queue render cleanup on worker thread to prevent use-after-free (GPU)

## 0.17.0

- Improved default conversion/normalization process, now out-of-the-box results should be better & more natural.
- Camera white balance is now applied by default — images open with the camera's as-shot WB for a balanced starting point.
- Replaced the "Camera WB" toggle with a "Linear RAW" button. Enable it to decode RAW files with neutral (1,1,1,1) multipliers, bypassing the camera WB.
- Added **Vignette effect**: new Finishing sidebar section with Strength and Size sliders. Applies a radial cosine-falloff vignette post-crop in both CPU and GPU pipelines. Negative strength darkens edges, positive brightens them.
- Moved **border controls** from the Export section to the new Finishing section. Border Width is now a slider. Old workspace files with border settings are automatically migrated.
- Increased range of **Analysis buffer** slider.
- Better error recovery in edge cases (swapchain resizing, invalid crop ratios).
- Config deserialization now warns on unknown keys — old workspace files with renamed settings won't silently lose data.
- More tests for GPU-CPU feature parity.
- Removed some dependencies that were not used.
- Added test coverage reporting to CI.
- UI refinements.

## 0.16.0

- Fix: rendering crash on some DNG and TIFF files at extreme D-Range Clip values (`kth out of bounds` error from `np.percentile` on float32 arrays.
- Fix: NaN/inf pixels in loaded images no longer propagate into normalization bounds.
- Fix: color cast on some files (cr3, raf) files.
- Fix: unsupported RAW files now show a clear error in the status bar instead of crashing.
- Updated rawpy/libraw: fixes loading of Panasonic Lumix .RW2 files from newer camera models.
- Updated many other dependencies.

**Dropped intel mac support due to lack of support for newer rawpy/libraw!**

## 0.15.0

- Add customizable slider shortcuts for all controls @alessandrv
- Fix: preview display issues (Windows) @alessandrv
- Fix: JPEG and TIFF scans now correctly linearized from sRGB before processing — density curves and color response now physically accurate for scanned negatives.
- Fix: GPU pipeline failures now log a full stack trace instead of a single-line message, making hardware acceleration issues diagnosable.
- Fix: GPU readback buffer correctly unmapped on error, preventing render failures after a hardware exception.
- UX: Make UI more subdued, replace intensive reds with subtle greys.

## 0.14.2

- Fix regression: loading monochrome DNG files no longer crashes the app (segfault in display conversion and pixel readout).

## 0.14.1

- Added **`override.toml`**: a config file in `Documents/NegPy/` (created on first run) for forcing GPU backend, Qt rendering, texture size cap, and more — without touching the app. See [Troubleshooting](../README.md#-troubleshooting) for details.
- Fix: **D-Range Clip** slider now uses a logarithmic scale for much finer control at low values.
- Fix: **Autocrop Offset** maximum raised to 100, allowing larger offsets on wide-border scans.
- Fix: 16-bit color TIFF exports now use a proper 16-bit ICC color transform.
- Fix: copy-pasted edits not persisting without additional manual change or explicit "Save".
- UX: Added empty-state overlay on the canvas when no image is loaded.
- Performance & stability improvements.

## 0.14.0

- Added **Split Toning**: independent shadow and highlight color tinting with hue (0–360°) and strength controls. Works on both color and B&W scans. Applied in Lab space — luminance is preserved exactly.
- **Per-section reset buttons**: each collapsible sidebar section header now has a reset button to restore that section's defaults without touching other settings.
- **Canvas background color**: three swatch buttons in the toolbar (Black / Dark Grey / Mid Grey) to set the viewport background.
- **Keyboard shortcut overlay**: press `?` to open a modal reference of all shortcuts.
- **Persistent UI preferences**: HQ preview toggle, canvas background color, auto dust removal default, and ICC profile settings (path, direction, apply-to-export) now survive app restarts.
- **Slider improvements**: sliders now show a tick mark at the default position; numeric units (px, °) displayed on relevant sliders; drag the slider label horizontally to scrub its value (hold Shift for fine control, Ctrl for coarse).
- **Cursor pixel readout**: hovering over the canvas shows the pixel's RGB and Lab values in the status bar.
- **Right click menu**: added as quicker way to access some tools/functions when right-clickign on image preview.
- Improved normalization: simplified per-channel floor analysis for more consistent results across different film stocks.
- Increased CMY white balance range for stronger correction capability.
- Toning: Selenium & Sepia sliders now hidden in color mode; Paper Profile section moved below toning controls with a clear label.
- Lab: color-only sliders (Separation, Saturation, Vibrance, Denoise) now hidden in B&W mode instead of greyed out.
- Exposure: Global / Shadows / Highlights region selector replaced with three toggle buttons; CMY label colors shift subtly per region for visual context.
- Collapsible sidebar sections now show a red dot indicator when they contain non-default values.
- Added info tooltips to many sliders.
- Many small UI refinements.
- GPU acceleration failure now shown as a status message instead of silently falling back to CPU.
- Stability: fixed GPU staging buffer leak on device loss/OOM; fixed dangling thread on app quit; thumbnail failures now surface as status bar errors.

## 0.13.2

- Fix regression: Changing camera wb, crop ratio, crop offset, manual crop, or resetting crop now forces normalization bounds re-analysis.
- Fix: Process mode change now correctly clears both floor and ceiling bounds (previously only ceiling was cleared).
- Fix: Corrupted RAW files (partial data errors) no longer crash the loader — app falls back gracefully.
- Updated dependencies: PyQt6 6.11.0, wgpu 0.31.0. (might help crashes with newer nvidia drivers)

## 0.13.1

- Fix: Pick WB not updating magenta & yellow sliders

## 0.13.0
